  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>Airports today are much like railroads in the old Wild West in which communities connected by rail usually thrived while those not connected by rail often died. Airports are essential for modern economic development, particularly for isolated, rural regions of the United States.</p> 
  <p>For Pullman-Moscow, air travel is especially important given its geographically isolated location and underdeveloped highways and limited rail service. Currently, the Pullman-Moscow Airport is at a crossroads. The total cost of the planned realignment project is projected to reach $120 million. While most of funding will be provided by federal government, the project requires sizable local matching funds. In addition, the project is complicated by the airport’s unique two-state, two-community and two-university jurisdiction.</p> 
  <p>While the costs to the communities are substantial, prior analyses suggest that benefits are benefits are likely to be much higher than costs and will likely increase sharply in the future. The focus of this study was to fully assess the impact and integration of the Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport in the regional economy and its future role after the runway realignment.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>A basketball player? A guitarist? A scientist? If you had asked your 6th-grade self to describe who you were — to explain your identity — how would you have responded? And what is your reply to that same question today? How we view ourselves, and how those views and descriptions change over time and with different audiences, set the stage for achieving our own potential as professionals and as people. </p> 
  <p>During this colloquium, Lee Vierling will share his experiences working across a wide range of professional disciplines to solve problems, and use these experiences to discuss recent work by colleagues at the College of Natural Resources’ McCall Outdoor Science School (MOSS) to study how young learners develop their own sense of identity by practicing science. We will engage in a group exercise to understand how our own identities are shaped by those around us, and how this affects our ability to work as individuals and in teams. </p> 
  <h3>Biography</h3> 
  <p>Lee Vierling arrived at University of Idaho in 2004 after stints working at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, NASA and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. He now serves as executive director of the UI-CNR McCall Field Campus and MOSS. He is professor and incoming department head of the interdisciplinary Department of Natural Resources and Society. He has published more than 90 scientific articles, mostly interdisciplinary in nature. In 6th grade, he wanted to become a race car driver. However, when asked to describe himself now, Vierling identifies as an ecologist, environmental scientist, remote sensing scientist, sports fan, singer and father, depending on who is asking.</p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>This presentation will discuss the pleasures, challenges and surprises of writing “Through A Long Absence,” a literary memoir about Joy Passanante’s father, who died of Alzheimer’s disease four years before she began to write about him. Researched through his letters, diaries, taped interviews, paintings, music and the writer’s own memory and imagination — as well as investigations in six European countries, following his wartime footsteps with her husband, Gary Williams — the book tells the story of Bart Passanante, a first-generation American serving in the Army as a doctor overseas during World War II. In addition to describing her process in uncovering and constructing her father’s story, Passanante will read passages from her manuscript.</p> 
  <h4>Biography</h4> 
  <p>Joy Passanante worked for the University of Idaho until her retirement in 2014, as a teacher of more than 20 different courses as well as an editor, communications consultant and trainer, and writer. For 12 years, she served as the university’s associate director of Creative Writing. She has published three books in addition to poems, essays and stories in various literary journals.</p> 
  <p>Both her collection of stories, “The Art of Absence,” and her novel, “My Mother’s Lovers,” were finalists for several national awards. Her essays have received awards from the prominent literary journal Shenandoah and from the Magazine Association of the Southeast.</p> 
  <p>She has garnered Idaho Commission on the Arts Fellowships for poetry and fiction and an Idaho Humanities Fellowship for nonfiction. She recently completed her first book of literary nonfiction.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>Using technology in the classroom has helped students improve their knowledge and critical thinking skills, as well as keep them engaged and interested in a variety of subjects such as math, history, geography and finance. Nationwide, more schools are receiving funding for technology in the classroom. However, many teachers are struggling to find meaningful ways to incorporate these technologies into the classroom.</p> 
  <p>Two Family and Consumer Sciences Extension faculty, Martha Raidl and Rhea Lanting, worked with a College of Education technology specialist, Cassidy Hall, to address this problem by designing a youth online curriculum called “The e-Potato: A multidisciplinary and multimedia program.” It is focused around potatoes, a commonly consumed vegetable, especially by children. Originally designed as a farm-to-school program, as a way to introduce local agriculture into a nutrition program, the “e-Potato” was expanded to be used by students to cover nine disciplines: science, technology, engineering, math, history, geography, health, nutrition and agriculture.</p> 
  <h3>Biography</h3> 
  <p><strong>Martha Raidl</strong> is a professor and extension nutrition education specialist for the School of Family and Consumer Sciences. She has been employed with the University of Idaho since 1998 and is based in Boise. As a registered dietitian, she is interested in developing, testing and evaluating nutrition education materials, targeting those with Type 2 diabetes, and incorporating multimedia into nutrition education programs.</p> 
  <p><strong>Cassidy Hall</strong> is the interim director and technology integration specialist for the College of Education’s Doceo Center for Innovation + Learning, as well as a clinical assistant professor of learning technologies in the Department of Curriculum &amp; Instruction. Hall travels throughout the state to provide professional development focused on technology integration to K-12 teachers and leads the Doceo Center efforts in supporting technology integration for faculty on campus.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>Approximately 190 million people in the United States play video games, and the rate of engagement in this form of entertainment is increasing rapidly. Video games are therefore a viable avenue for the large-scale dissemination of educational material. The “gamer” demographic also facilitates broader impacts related to diversity and recruitment in STEM fields. For example, 48 percent of gamers are women and girls, and women over 30 are the single largest demographic sector of video game players.</p> 
  <p>We are working with undergraduate and graduate students from engineering, science and the arts to create evolutionary video games. Our premise is that evolutionary biology can be used to make better video games, because the enemies evolve and adapt to player defensive strategies. Because these games are built upon real models of evolution, they can be used to teach, demonstrate and study evolutionary biology. These projects also allow students to experience the discomfort and rewards of interdisciplinary collaboration and build their communication skills.</p> 
  <h3>Biography</h3> 
  <p><strong>Barrie Robison</strong> is an associate professor of biology. His research is focused on behavioral adaptation to captivity, behavioral genomics and nutritional genomics. He has been a connoisseur of video games since 1977.</p> 
  <p><strong>Terence Soule</strong> is a professor of computer science. His research focuses on evolutionary computation, the use of evolutionary models to evolve solutions to practical problems, including the evolution of cooperation.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>In 1935, Soviet military intelligence sent Artur Aleksandrovich Adams on a secret mission in the United States. Over the next decade, working as a technical engineer, Adams recruited and ran a spy ring whose tentacles reached from Washington to Los Alamos. In 1944, he gave Moscow critical information on the American super-secret Manhattan Project. Evading an FBI dragnet, he returned to the U.S.S.R., where he died in 1969, a forgotten man.</p> 
  <p>In fact, Adams’ work for the Soviet “secret services” began as early as 1918. An examination of available records reveals his constant re-invention of himself to disguise his clandestine work and even shows that he was less than honest with his Soviet superiors. Did “Arthur Adams” ever really exist at all, and if he didn’t, who was he?</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>The presence of water in liquid form is the single most important factor in the search for extraterrestrial life. Here on earth, it has been said that water is the oil of the future. It is not. The fact that water is essential for life and has no substitute means that while its use can be improved and enhanced through technology, careful consideration of socioeconomic factors and governance are of equal importance.</p> 
  <p>Australia and the western United States share both a legal foundation in British common law and climatic conditions of aridity. This suggests that Australia and the western U.S. might learn from each other as each prepares to adapt to the changes in water demand and supply that are beginning to play out at the intersection of climate change and growth in population.</p> 
  <p>Australia was the initial ground for experimentation when it responded to the 15-year Millennium Drought with water reform. California is now ground zero. Because Idaho is the second-largest user of water for irrigated agriculture in the United States, the largest user of water for aquaculture and the most reliant on groundwater for domestic and municipal purposes, it may be able to learn from these experiments. This presentation will discuss why and how we allocate water and what that means for response to drought in Australia and the western United States.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>When you see or hear a media account of a court decision, you will learn who “won” and “lost” — and the story often will be accompanied by quotes of praise or condemnation from the parties and various interest groups. In a high-profile case, you also may find yourself immersed in punditry about the political implications of the decision or the perceived political leanings of the judge(s).</p> 
  <p>But how much will you learn about the legal principle(s) governing the court’s decision? Has your secondary and post-secondary education prepared you to look for the “rule of law” in reports of court decisions?</p> 
  <p>In today’s environment of hyper-partisanship, how fully do Americans understand (and appreciate) the role of an independent and impartial judiciary as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution? Drawing upon illustrative cases and interdisciplinary scholarship, professor Don Burnett will address these questions.</p> 
  <h3>Biography</h3> 
  <p><strong>Don Burnett</strong> came to the University of Idaho in 2001 as dean of the College of Law. He served in that capacity and as a classroom teacher until 2013, when he was appointed as interim president of the university. In 2014, he returned to the College of Law faculty, teaching classes at the college’s campus in Moscow. In addition, he serves as a program coordinator for the newly established Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center, a collaborative undertaking of the College of Law and the Idaho Supreme Court in Boise. Burnett previously served as professor and dean of the Louis D. Brandeis School of Law at the University of Louisville, as a founding judge of the Idaho Court of Appeals and as president of the Idaho State Bar. An Idaho native, he received his education at Harvard University, the University of Chicago, the University of Virginia and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>John Mullan&rsquo;s celebrated road, a 625-mile link that connected the Missouri and Columbia rivers and eventually became a significant component of Interstate 90, established the West Point graduate as an accomplished engineer. Although the road&rsquo;s significance in settling the Northwest is mentioned in nearly every book about the region, Mullan himself has remained an enigma: A dashing young Army officer who came west and built an important highway, but then disappears from the written record. But Mullan lived to see automobiles traveling his former wagon road. Petersen traveled to repositories from coast to coast in his search for the real John Mullan. This new biography reveals a complex personality who skirted legal and ethical boundaries to gain fame and wealth.</p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>Gabourey Sidibe rose to fame in 2009 with her Oscar-nominated performance in Precious and quickly became an icon of inclusivity in Hollywood. As U.S. media increasingly touted the rise of a “post-racial” culture in the wake of the election of the first black president, Sidibe’s successes on American Horror Story, The Big C and Fox’s new hit Empire seemingly demonstrated new possibilities for those whose body size and skin tone deviate from traditional definitions of stardom. This talk explores these possibilities as well as the limitations of “post-racial” stardom by analyzing the insistent focus on self-confidence in Sidibe’s star persona. Exploring the relationship between post-racial media discourse and neoliberal individualism, the presentation will show how Sidibe’s star persona celebrates individual solutions to social problems and a colorblind model of universal womanhood. </p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>Within the last ten years, frontier forests of Central America have become a strategic distribution center for drug traffickers transporting cocaine from South America into the United States. While drug trafficking is known to have deleterious societal effects, the relationship between drug trafficking and deforestation in Central America is not well understood.</p> 
  <p>This research investigates the connection between drug trafficking and deforestation in the Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve (RPBR) of Honduras. Remote sensing analyses of Landsat and SPOT images show that deforestation rates have accelerated and the size of deforestation patches have increased in the RPBR in the last ten &nbsp;years.</p> 
  <p>Results from secondary data, key informant interviews and community surveys conducted, indicate that the direct and indirect effects of drug money laundering through cattle ranching are a major driver of tropical deforestation. Under these circumstances, market-based payments from REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) for forest conservation are neither politically tenable nor economically powerful enough to stop forest conversion.</p> 
  <p>These results reveal new proximate and underlying drivers of deforestation in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. Recommendations for REDD+ include project designs that support local governance and provide development opportunities to stem land-use change driven by lucrative, albeit illegal activities.</p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>The first discovery of fossils in the Clarkia area was in 1972 during the construction of a snowmobile racetrack. The fossils, primarily plant remains, are preserved in the sediments of a Miocene lake bed. The lake was formed 15 million to 15&frac12; million years ago by the damming of a drainage basin very similar to the present day St. Maries River basin. The ancient lake was relatively narrow and as deep as 100 to 150 meters. Because of cold, anoxic bottom water and a high rate of sedimentation, preservation of the local biota was excellent. During the last 15 million years, this area has remained tectonically stable, resulting in little post-depositional change of any biota remains trapped in the sediments. Leaves often show original fall colors (brown, red and yellow).</p> 
  <h4>Biography</h4> 
  <p>Bill Rember, affiliate professor of Geological Sciences at the University of Idaho, is director of UI’s Tertiary Research Center. He has been unearthing and studying the Clarkia fossil flora of northern Idaho for decades. Rember is an active member of the White Pine Chapter of the Idaho Native Plant Society. He promotes ongoing interest and scientific knowledge of the significant but undervalued Clarkia fossil beds.</p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>Interdisciplinary efforts are critical to address the complex problems our society faces. This talk will highlight a model for educating doctoral students for careers involving interdisciplinary, team-based research created as part of two National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Research and Education Traineeship (NSF-IGERT) projects. The educational model was developed by faculty at the University of Idaho and the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center (CATIE) in Costa Rica. The model involves: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Identification of integrated research questions combining team members’ disciplines;</li> 
   <li>Coursework to review theoretical underpinnings of interdisciplinarity and develop integrated research proposals to address research questions;</li> 
   <li>Meetings and workshops to enhance team cohesiveness;</li> 
   <li>Engagement with stakeholders;</li> 
   <li>Interdisciplinary team research that yields joint dissertation chapters and publications.&nbsp;</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The model achieved a level of integration unique among graduate education programs. More than 40 doctoral students have participated over the past 15 years. Using examples from IGERT projects, the talk will emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary team research and training for graduate students.</p> 
  <h4>Biography</h4> 
  <p>Nilsa Bosque-P&eacute;rez obtained her B.Sc. in agronomy and soil science from the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag&uuml;ez, and her M.S. and Ph.D. in entomology at the University of California, Davis. A UI faculty member since 1997, she serves as project director and student mentor in the UI-CATIE NSF-IGERT project “Evaluating resilience of ecological and social systems in changing landscapes.” She previously served as Director of the IGERT project “Ecosystem management in tropical and temperate regions: integrating education in sustainable production and biodiversity conservation” (2001-2008). Her many awards include the UI’s Award for Excellence in Interdisciplinary or Collaborative Efforts.</p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>The music of J. S. Bach has such universal appeal because it speaks to universal human experience. Suffering, alienation, death, yearning, redemption: these are the big questions Bach addresses in his sacred vocal music. This year’s Idaho Bach Festival (October 15-17) features some of Bach’s most heart-rending settings of religious texts: “Lass, o Welt, mich aus Verachtung in betr&uuml;bter Einsamkeit” (“Leave me, o scornful world, in troubled loneliness”) and “Ich habe genug” (“I have enough”). This presentation will explore Bach’s musical treatment of serious religious subject matter in these compositions and will include a performance of movements from his Six Suites for Solo Cello.</p> 
  <h4>Biography</h4> 
  <p>Miranda Wilson is assistant professor of cello and double bass at the Lionel Hampton School of Music, University of Idaho. She is co-artistic director of the <a href=""/class/music/news"">Idaho Bach Festival</a>.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>While the Classroom Strategic Planning Workgroup was noticing an increased demand for both classroom technology and flexible spaces with moveable furniture, the Doceo Center for Innovation + Learning was experiencing a demand for its lab space by faculty seeking to innovate their active learning style courses. A collaborative effort between the two groups was born to attempt to make these spaces a reality on campus. The new College of Education building will fulfill a need for both types of spaces when it reopens in the fall of 2016. This presentation will describe the formation of an active learning discussion circle and how the planning of these spaces evolved.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>Next year will mark 80 years since the outbreak in 1936 of Spain’s Civil War. This brutal war lasted for nearly three years (July 1936-March 1939), claiming at least one-half million lives and sending another one-half million refugees into exile. For Ernest Hemingway, the fight against General Francisco Franco became a cause of utmost importance. In March 1937, he traveled to Madrid to observe conditions firsthand. Reporting on the war for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA), Hemingway penned 31 dispatches from Spain. He also helped to produce a pro-Republican film, &quot;The Spanish Earth.&quot; His experiences during the civil war provided the material for what many consider to be Hemingway’s most famous novel, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1940). This presentation touches on debates related to Hemingway’s presence in Spain and his actions on behalf of the Republic.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>The law is commonly understood — by lawyers and non-lawyers alike — as text. And the practice of law is similarly understood as an exercise in the interpretation of text as it might apply in a particular factual context. But the law is, of course, more than just text. Law is an integral component of the physical landscape, and contemporary landscapes are shaped by law as much as any other factor. Law is also a product of the landscapes it helps create, as our cultural understandings of nature, its purpose and our relationship with it develop as we interact with specific places and landscapes. As we seek to understand particular places and the people who are parts of those places, and specifically how we might appropriately manage natural resources and landscapes, we must learn to recognize the law as its winds its way through and creates a place. In this presentation, Long will share stories of a few places in the Greater Yellowstone area of southeastern Idaho to illustrate how we might better understand the interactions of law, culture and the meaning of the physical landscape. </p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>Graduate students at the University of Idaho, with faculty advisors, surveyed stakeholders in Idaho to assess perceived impacts of climate change to natural resources across the state. This survey led to a set of long-term physical and biological observations that compose climate indicators for the state of Idaho. From the timing of lilac blooms and mountain bluebird nest records to the amount of snowpack and streamflow, these climate indicators provide a comprehensive picture of climate variability and change in Idaho for the past 30 to 100 years. Now published in Weather, Climate and Society, the research is coupled with outreach literature and a website soon to be made available to the public. </p> 
  <h3>Biographies</h3> 
  <p><strong>John Abatzoglou</strong> is an associate professor in the Department of Geography. His research interests are in climate science and meteorology specific to the American West. He works on both theoretical aspects of climate, as well as applied climatology and climate impacts on water resources, ecology and agriculture.</p> 
  <p><strong>Timothy Link</strong> is an associate professor of forest hydrology in the College of Natural Resources. His research focuses broadly on how climate, vegetation, and human activities influence hydrological processes from the point to the small watershed scale. Specific research topics focus on how vegetation affects snowpack and related ecological processes, how climate changes will be manifested in the rain-snow transition zone in complex terrain, and how forest management activities affect water flow, quality and riparian systems.</p> 
  <p><strong>Penny Morgan</strong> is a professor in the College of Natural Resources. She earned her bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Utah State University and her doctorate at the University of Idaho. Her current research focuses on some of the broad challenges facing people in the West: How will the changing climate influence fire occurrence and severity? Where, when and why do fires burn severely? What drives landscape dynamics, and how can we best manage landscape change? How does vegetation recover following large fires, and how does post-fire management affect weeds and other vegetation regrowth?</p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>Color vision in vertebrates requires the existence of multiple types of cone photoreceptors in the retina, each of which has a different sensitivity to the visual spectrum. Spectral sensitivities are conferred by the visual pigment present within cone photoreceptors. In primates and in fishes, the diversity of cone photoreceptor types has been increased through evolutionarily recent duplications of visual pigment genes.</p> 
  <p>In humans, the tandemly duplicated “red pigment” and “green pigment” genes on the X chromosome underlie trichromatic color vision. Defects in these genes result in color blindness and X-linked retinal degenerations. Treatments for some of these disorders would be facilitated by further knowledge of how differential gene expression — the production of a red pigment vs. a green pigment — is regulated in developing cone photoreceptors.</p> 
  <p>Our research group has recently uncovered evidence that the expression of pigments from a similar tandemly replicated red pigment gene array in zebrafish can be regulated by the developmental signaling molecules, retinoic acid, and thyroid hormone. Our findings suggest that tandemly duplicated cone pigment genes may be amenable to therapeutic manipulation.</p> 
  <h4>Biography</h4> 
  <p>Deborah Stenkamp is a professor of Biological Sciences and the current College of Science Malcolm and Carol Renfrew faculty fellow. She has maintained an NIH-supported research program in development and regeneration of the visual system, at the University of Idaho, since 1997. She earned a bachelor’s degree in biology from Whitman College and a doctorate from Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>The five tribes of Idaho — Coeur d’Alene, Kootenai, Nez Perce, Shoshone-Bannock tribes and the Shoshone-Paiute tribes — have transformed into regional economic powerhouses over the past quarter century. Their economic footprints now exceed $1 billion annually. The tribes are ranked in the top three largest employers for each of their respective regional economies. Their robust economic contributions arise from their unique role in Idaho’s economy. Each of the tribes is an independent sovereign nation that carries out functions similar to those of state governments. In addition, each is a full-scale economic development agency with unique private-public partnerships. This presentation will outline the economic activities of the five Idaho tribes, their roles in regional economies and growth possibilities for the future.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>Coeur d’Alene tribal professionals in natural and cultural resources and tribal elders, and University of Idaho faculty researchers in anthropology, data management, natural resources and virtual-world technology worked as co-investigators on a project that demonstrates the value and applicability of indigenous knowledge/practice as complementary to empirical science in addressing climate change. The project focuses on the Schitsu’umsh knowledge and practice, called <em>hnkhwelkhwlnet</em> “our ways of life in the world,” associated with the traditional root food, <em>sqigwts / Sagittaria latifolia</em> (“water potato”). The <em>hnkhwelkhwlnet</em> insights offered are applicable to climate change, vividly demonstrating how a place-based tribe responds to changes in its environment over time.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>What happens behind the scenes in an opera star's life? This presentation will demonstrate how genealogical and court documents from Viennese church and state archives provide a realistic view of how two prominent court opera singers, Irene Tomeoni (ca. 1763-1830) and Theresia Saal (1782-1855), negotiated their professional and personal lives. The results are not quite what one would expect — equal pay for equal work, paid maternity leave, retirement planning through real estate investment — leading us to challenge assumptions that women had no financial or legal power in patriarchal 19th-century Vienna.</p> 
  <h3>Biography</h3> 
  <p><strong>Carol Padgham Albrecht</strong> is an associate professor of music history and oboe in the Lionel Hampton School of Music. In addition to the oboe studio, she teaches courses in music history from A.D. 900 to 1900, with a particular emphasis on the music and culture of Viennese classicism. A UI faculty member since 1989, Albrecht has conducted archival work in Vienna every summer since 1998, and has written numerous papers and articles about the imperial court opera establishment there.</p>
