  <br />Abstract: Since its beginning in Britain in the 1950's, the field of Cultural Studies has in many ways defined what a possible interdisciplinary discipline might be. Unfortunately, the project of cultural studies has been splintered and diluted in many of its manifestations in American academic institutions. Visual Culture, a relatively new and still burgeoning discipline, has possibly (or could possibly) embrace and 
  <br />disseminate many of cultural studies' most important contributions as an interdisciplinary field. I will outline and discuss the intersections between cultural studies and visual culture while raising some possible future contributions of the latter in terms of some ofthe most important cultural questions in our world today.

  <br />Abstract: The Galapagos Islands are best known for their biota, but they also form one of nature's premier natural laboratories for studying the earth's deep interior. The islands are situated adjacent to a giant spreading crack that forms a boundary between two of the earth's tectonic plates, where a characteristic type of magma is produced from the shallow mantle. In contrast, the magmas that have constructed the Galapagos Islands are thought to be derived from a plume upwelling from the earth's deep mantle, and they have a different characteristic composition. The compositions of the erupted lavas can therefore be used as a tracer, to show extensive mixing between the mantle plume and the upper part of the earth's mantle. Once magma is produced, it ascends builds up beneath the volcanoes, causing their surfaces to bulge. We use precision GPS measurements that are telemetered to the University of Idaho to measure this swelling. Sierra Negra volcano is currently (as of September 1) expanding at 77 cm/y, which we attribute to over 10 million cubic meters of magma pushing up from a depth of only 2 km.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Three years ago the state of Idaho was offered a unique opportunity to enhance its biomedical research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requested proposals to build a statewide research network to increase the number of grant awards in states like Idaho that traditionally receive a small share of research grants. Because of unprecedented cooperation between the three universities, UI, ISU and BSU, Idaho received $8.3 M in funding over three years. 
  <br />
  <br />Under the BRIN (Biomedical Research Infrastructure Network) Program, researchers, students and postdoctoral fellows realized improved research facilities, release time from teaching, start up costs and seed grants to improve the output of biomedical research. During this time Idaho doubled its NIH grant support, leading the nation in rate of growth. Building on this success we applied for and recently received $16M over five years to extend the research network to the other colleges and universities in the state. The long term goal of these programs is to create sustainable growth in research. That means technology transfer, jobs and a developing bioscience industrial base. Central to this mission is building a core strength in bioinformatics and a high speed telecommunications network that will surmount geographic barriers. Cooperation and collaboration are the operative terms that will be necessary if Idaho is to capitalize on this opportunity to promote future research in the state.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: The public image of chemistry is not so positive. What's the first word you associate with &quot;chemical&quot;? (usually: toxic). The American Chemical Society's (ACS) National Chemistry Week (NCW) was an idea invented by George Pimentel and implemented by Helen Free, to get the word out on the positive contributions of chemists and chemistry. For the last decade we have been involved with NCW, highlighting positive things that chemistry contributes. For example, one place chemistry is usually mentioned in a positive light is on the sports page, and our program &quot;The Chemistry of winning Teams&quot; reminded the general public that chemistry is involved in making protective sports equipment. 
  <br />
  <br />Native Americans are underrepresented in science and engineering. When we were planning our National Chemistry Week activities for 2001, we put some thought into how to include Native American students and teachers in our activities. Using a Tony Hillerman murder mystery novel as a lead reference, we developed a theme as a focus for our activities &quot;A Periodic Table of the Moles&quot;. The mole is the unit which chemists use to discuss molecules, and has also become the unofficial mascot of the ACS. The mole is also an animal in Native American creation stories. Southwest tribes have gained renown for their skill as sculptors, and small mole sculptures are available of numerous minerals, all of which have well known chemical compositions. 
  <br />
  <br />We've collected quite a few of these sculptures, and arranged them in an approximate periodic table to emphasize the chemical nature of materials, this is on permanent display in Renfrew Hall. We have involved HOIST students in our programs, and one of our students, Feather Broncheau, became the first Native American UI student to make a presentation at a National ACS Meeting. This year's NCW theme is health. We've worked with Solo Greene of the Nez Perce Environmental Restoration and Waste Management program, to chemically analyze one of the traditional herbal medicines. What I think is noteworthy is that we involved Nez Perce students Jacob Taylor and Trina Villalobos in the study. The long range goal is to mentor students to become teachers and role models. I'll show you lots of pictures of moles, and how a chemist goes about studying the chemical composition of an herbal medicine.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Since 1992, an important project of canon expansion has been underway, under the auspices of the University of Chicago Press and with considerable financial backing from the National Endowment for the Humanities. &quot;The Other Voice in Early Modern Europe&quot; is a series of primary source texts written predominantly by women in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Holland, Belgium, the Scandinavian countries, Poland, and Russia between 1400 and 1750. The purpose of the series is to enlarge the canon of historical, literary, and philosophical authors and texts, by making available in inexpensive and easily accessible English editions, texts that had previously been untranslated and unavailable in modern editions, some existing only in manuscript. The volumes of the series are published simultaneously in hardcover and paperback; they are a boon to students of western culture in general, whether in school or out, although they are intended especially for assignment in college classrooms. 
  <br />
  <br />In my talk I will discuss my involvement with this project, which includes not only the publication of the texts in the &quot;Other Voice&quot; series but also an effort at integration of these texts into college and secondary curricula. Over the past several years one of the series editors, Albert Rabil, has been organizing NEH summer institutes on early modern women writers in Europe for college and high school teachers (college teachers in 2001 and 2003; high school in 2002 and 2004). In July 2003, I attended one of these institutes at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill; following on that experience, I was given the opportunity to translate and edit the texts for one of the projected volumes in the series, the memoirs of the sisters Hortense and Marie Mancini. After a ten-minute presentation of the &quot;Other Voice&quot; series and the related project of curricular development, I will devote the rest of my talk to a discussion of the Mancini sisters and the interest of their memoirs for modern readers. 
  <br />
  <br />Published in 1675 and 1677 respectively, the memoirs of Hortense and of Marie Mancini represent nearly the earliest examples in France of women’s accounts of their own lives, published under their own names and during their lifetimes. Furthermore, the lived experience that the two sisters recount conforms to no contemporary mold: nieces of the powerful Cardinal Mazarin and members of the court of Louis XIV, they fled their unhappy marriages and chose the unheard-of alternative of independent travel and a life on the road. In choosing to publish their memoirs, Hortense and Marie extend their acts of self-determination to the discursive realm. As both make clear at the start of their memoirs, they write in order to rehabilitate their reputations; in other words, by telling their own stories in print, they are reclaiming the right to define their public images themselves. Moreover, the publication of their personal stories is very much a strategic action with repercussions both within the circle of their own lives and beyond it, in the broader culture of their time. It is a maneuver in their drawn-out struggles with their husbands—indeed, Hortense’s text was actually entered as evidence, first by her side and later by her husband’s, in their legal battles; but because of their prominence, it is also a contribution to the public debate on marriage. The two memoirs offer a rare look at the negotiation of personal independence within the confines of early modern aristocratic women’s lives.

  <br />Dirk Vanderwall - Animal and Veterinary Science 
  <br />
  <br />Abstract: The ability to clone mammals using somatic cell nuclear transfer (e.g., Dolly the sheep) has been recognized as a scientific milestone, because it demonstrated that a fully differentiated somatic cell from the body can be genetically “reprogrammed” back to the undifferentiated state of a one-cell zygote (embryo), which can then initiate and undergo complete embryonic/fetal development resulting in the birth of an animal genetically identical to the original cell donor. Potential uses of equine cloning include: 1) preservation of genetics from individual animals that would otherwise not be able to reproduce such as geldings (castrated males), 2) preservation of genetic material of endangered and/or exotic species such as Przewalski’s horse and 3) because of the companion animal role that horses fill for some individuals, it is likely that some horse owners will have individual animals cloned for emotional fulfillment. Of these, cloning geldings to produce reproductively intact males for breeding purposes will likely be the first direct application of equine cloning. Although some breed associations (e.g., The Jockey Club, American Quarter Horse Association) do not presently allow the registration of cloned animals, for some equine sporting activities (dressage, show-jumping) breed registry status is irrelevant, which eliminates that regulatory impediment to the use of cloning technology. 
  <br />
  <br />2003 was a notable year for equine cloning. We reported the birth of three mule foals cloned from a fetal fibroblast cell line (Science 2003;301:1063) and Galli et al. (Nature 2003;424:635) reported the birth of a horse foal cloned from an adult fibroblast cell line. Despite the recent success of equine cloning, like other species, the efficiency of equine cloning is low; less than 3% of cloned embryos produced with our current cloning system result in offspring. Based on experience with other species, the primary problem contributing to the inefficiency of cloning is “cloned offspring syndrome”, which is characterized by a high incidence of embryonic, fetal and/or placental developmental abnormalities that result in extremely high rates of embryonic loss, abortion and stillbirths throughout gestation; and compromised neonatal health after birth. Cloned offspring syndrome has been especially problematic in cattle and sheep where problems are manifested throughout gestation and the neonatal period. The embryonic/fetal and/or placental developmental abnormalities that result in abortion, stillbirth or compromised neonatal health are thought to reflect incomplete or abnormal genetic reprogramming of the donor nucleus, specifically related to critically important imprinted genes. Future work in the area of equine cloning will be directed at understanding the factors that contribute to the current inefficiency of the cloning process, which clearly has relevance to the clinical (future) application of this emerging technology.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: &quot;Turning your World Upside Down: A Sabbatical Adventure&quot; 
  <br />The opportunity to take a sabbatical leave is one of the privileges of an otherwise wonderful job. The term “sabbatical year” is derived from an ancient practice whereby every seventh year vineyards and fields remained fallow and debtors were released from their obligations. In modern times, the sabbatical leave is defined (by Webster’s) as “a leave of absence, often with pay, usually granted every seventh year, as to a college professor, for travel, research, or rest.” At UI, the definition includes “study, work, or travel” (note the absence of “rest”!) in order to “enhance the faculty member’s value to UI.” 
  <br />
  <br />I will describe some of the wonderful adventures I had in Spring 2004 with a small subset of the 3000 photos I took. My travels took me from a modern university in southern Thailand to Nelson Mandela’s self-described university in prison on Robben Island in South Africa. I also discovered connections among a lead smelter in the Russian Far East, one in Zambia, and Idaho’s own Bunker Hill site that surprised me and validated years of work. 
  <br />
  <br />As a Humble Explorer of Planet Earth, I was reminded that serendipity is better than planning and that, in the words of Michael Faraday, “nothing is too wonderful to be true.”

  <br />Abstract: To achieve biodiversity conservation and sustainable production in anthropogenically fragmented landscapes, scientists need to be trained in a holistic fashion that emphasizes integration and interdisciplinary collaboration. Traditional graduate programs in conservation biology, forestry, and agriculture fall short of this goal as they train scientists with research skills in narrowly defined disciplines and rarely, if ever, facilitate integration across disciplines. We present an NSF funded experiment in graduate education that develops and evaluates an integrative educational model with an emphasis on developing interdisciplinary research skills and knowledge in the biological, physical and social sciences. This educational program involves researchers from 7 departments and 3 colleges at the University of Idaho plus four research areas at the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center (CATIE) in Costa Rica. Eighteen PhD students have been recruited to form 5 interdisciplinary teams that are addressing research questions in conservation biology and sustainability of agricultural and forestry production in temperate and tropical ecosystems. Team members representing biological, physical and social sciences work together to develop and implement interdisciplinary research projects. The structure, challenges and successes of this new graduate program will be highlighted.

  <br />Robert Wrigley - English 
  <br />
  <br />Abstract: There is considerable evidence to suggest that poetry may well be the least practical art in existence, though its impracticality, from the poet’s point of view, at least, is self-inflicted. It is a fact that no one in the United States of America can make a living writing poems. Some poets have made something like a living on what’s called “the reading circuit,” speaking their poems to audiences, becoming something more like itinerant performers of poetry than writers of it. But no genuine poet, writing with high literary standards, in this nation, has ever been able to support him/herself on what the world of publishers and readers will pay for the art. And yet, people keep on writing poems. People in ever-growing numbers want to be poets. And sales of poetry books are higher than ever American history. Why? Perhaps it is because there is no one more deeply and significantly in touch with language than poets. The poet’s language is, after all, the same language we use to woo and to wound, to sing and to curse, to sell and to offer salvation. It is, therefore, the poet’s job to redeem the language, to keep it honest, to show how important each individual word can be.

  <br />Abstract: I first became interested in evolutionary lag when its presence was thrust upon me during my long-term study of pronghorn. Several aspects of pronghorn behavior do not make sense when viewed from a current perspective, but make prefect sense when viewed as adaptations to the recent past. There are examples in many other species of the persistence of behavioral traits long after the selective forces that brought them about are gone. Humans are such a species. We retain many behavioral traits that are adaptations to a stone-age or pre-stone-age time. Several of these traits are not adaptive in modern society, but we are not likely to loose them soon.

  <br />Abstract: As scientists, we believe in and employ rational methods to develop an understanding of nature that allows explanation and prediction, but that is always restricted somehow in scope. In interdisciplinary collaborative research aimed at understanding problems involving complex systems, we must relax the restrictions on scope and in so doing lose explanatory and predictive power. Living in the world as human beings we have the potential and perhaps the obligation to be open to everything without trying to confine or explain. The presentation will explore the complementarity among these different points of view.

  <br />Abstract: Elected to the presidency of Venezuela in 1998 and 2000, survivor of an attempted coup d’&eacute;tat on an April weekend in 2002, President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez has been an outspoken advocate of social reform in his country and other countries in South America and the Caribbean Basin. These include urban and rural land reform, increased taxation on oil companies operating in Venezuela, the creation of “Bolivarian universities,” improved health care and access to housing in lower-class barrios, among others. In the words of President Ch&aacute;vez, “Socialism is love. We must reclaim socialism as a thesis, a project and a path, but a new type of socialism, a humanist one, which puts humans and not machines or the state ahead of everything.” Murals have informed and entertained observers around the world for the past 31,000 years. Since 1900, numerous talented muralists have expressed political and social ideals through images and phrases, particularly in South America. In countries where many citizens have had minimal formal education, murals are a rich and influential form of communication. Eighty percent of Venezuela’s 25 million inhabitants are marginalized. Murals painted on walls in cities and pueblos throughout Venezuela send messages to these people and to the world.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: One of the most impressive results of modern science is the tremendous progress that has been made in the understanding of nature and the universe in fundamental terms. The so-called &quot;Standard Model&quot; of physics shows how the many phenomena of this world can be explained on the basis of just a few fundamental principals. These recent advances may suggest that the development of a &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; is just an idea of modern times. That is not true. In fact, almost as long as humans have done science, they have tried to find general principals underlying all nature. Ancient Greek philosophers have played an outstanding role: There are amazing parallels between the ideas of Plato and the theories of modern particle physics. Thus, in this colloquium, I will review the basic ideas and changing perceptions of the intellectually most challenging dream of mankind pervading history from the antiquity to modern days: the final theory of all of nature.

   September 12th&nbsp;
  <br />Michael Nelson - Philosophy 
  <br />
  <br />Abstract: The wolf control debate has continued for many years. Although, in some respects, the debate seems to be at an impasse, it also has the potential to take on a fresh character as wolves recover throughout the lower 48 states. At a superficial level, the debate is fueled by rhetoric, argument, and political action (or inaction) of various kinds. At a deep level, the debate is motivated by groups with apparently conflicting worldviews. In some very important ways and for many participants in the debate, there is a pathological mismatch between these deeper motivations and the more superficial fueling. The mismatch is likely to be so great that it prevents anyone from adequately understanding how the worldviews actually conflict and how they may be more similar than is currently possible to appreciate. The purpose of this talk is to use formal (but accessible) philosophical tools to identify these unappreciated mismatches. This type of analysis provides the most promising means for identifying and dispensing with false conflicts, and for clarifying genuine conflicts. Although this analysis is, by itself, insufficient for solving this controversy, it is an essential, and previously under-appreciated, component of the ultimate solution. Except for those interested in conflict for its own sake, analyzes like that presented here would advance the interests of all participants in this debate.

In the late 19th century a dichotomy developed between musicians that were composers and those who were performers. In today's classical music world a performer will often collaborate with a composer in the creation of a new work. I will explore how these collaborations work and I'll play excerpts from three pieces for guitar that I have commissioned.

  <br />
  <br />ABSTRACT: Japanese full-scale invasion of China in 1937 led to the Japanese control of most of the strategically important locations in northern, central, and coastal China . The ruling Nationalist government fled to relocate in inland area in Chongqing . Communist forces remained in rural northern land far way from major battle grounds. Southwestern China , including the city of Guilin , however, was spared of the Japanese occupation between 1938 and 1944. It was in this fourth zone that many China 's leading intellectuals and some foreign scholars and journalists were able to stay active in China ’s war efforts. This talk examines the six years of cultural glamour in the city of Guilin and how it was transformed from a provincial town to a cosmopolitan cultural center in China ’s war of resistance against Japan . Important contributing factors, namely the role of the regional warlord, composition of intellectuals from “out of town” and their literary production, and activities of the international groups will be discussed.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Litigation between adoptive parents and unwed fathers is on the rise. Public (and political) attention was brought to the issue by the Baby Jessica case in the early 1990's. Even prior to that case, however, the United States Supreme Court had struck down state adoption statutes because they failed to protect the due process rights of unwed fathers in establishing relationships with their children. State legislatures have tended either to ignore or pay lip-service to the commands of the Court. Thus, state legislation intended to address the issue has only contributed to the increase in adoption litigation. In Idaho we have recently had two prominent cases in which adoptive placements have been disrupted because the interests of committed unwed fathers were violated. I will outline the constitutional problem, discuss a set of guidelines that would protect the legitimate interests of unwed fathers and propose a way for courts to resolve disputes that do arise quickly.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Images of fire are deeply rooted in the mythos of cultures around the globe. Of the many forces of nature, our relationship with fire is perhaps the most elemental and yet complex. Fire is both a creator and destroyer of worlds, requiring myth to help explain both its gifts and its perversely volatile nature. Prometheus in ancient Greek lore, the Phoenix in Arabian lore, and the image of a burning bush in Judeo-Christian tradition are but a few familiar fire images. Fire is used in music to convey uncontrollable passion. Witness the urgency in Jim Morrison's call to &quot;Light My Fire.&quot; Even today, the mythic figure of Smokey Bear looms large. In this image-rich presentation, Dr. Fins will explore our complex love/hate relationship with fire, including the socio-political-economic forces that made fire, particularly wildfire the enemy for much of the 20th century.

  <br />Abstract: This presentation describes and shows a video depicting three Palouse farm families. The video represents an exploratory use of visual and participatory methods for investigating and addressing issues of central concern to rural communities. As a research endeavor, this project seeks to understand the state of family farming, and how farmers themselves view it. As a community-centered, or applied research, effort the project offers family farmers a mechanism for acting on their knowledge.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: An ever-present challenge in structural engineering is the need to design something without knowing exactly how it will be used throughout its lifetime, what loads it will have to carry, or that it will even be built the way it was designed. In spite of the ignorance engineers face, they have designed successful structures for centuries. Ongoing research into loads and accelerating advances in computational methods have significantly reduced the amount of ignorance that an engineer must account for in his or her designs, but it is debatable as to whether or not these improvements have increased the reliability of built structures. This evolving understanding of engineering has a direct effect on us both in terms of safety and economics, which is illustrated by an on-going research effort focused on the Perrine bridge in southern Idaho.

  </u>Sean Quinlan - History 
  <br />
  <br />Abstract: In the early years of the Napoleonic Consulate and Empire (1799–1815), there appeared an extraordinarily popular (and salacious) medical literature on human sexuality, reproductive strategies, and child-rearing. These best-selling works, which formed a kind of medical ‘grub street’, included J.-A. Millot’s The Art of Making the Sexes at Will (1800), L.-J.-M. Robert’s Essay on Mega-Anthropogenesis (1801), and anonymous texts like The Propagation of the Human Species (1799) and Philopaedia, or the Art of Having Children without Passions (1808). 
  <br />
  <br />Using printed and manuscript sources from the period, this presentation explores this literature, showing how medical writers addressed these ‘how to’ sex manuals to the new fashionable and urbane elites of Napoleonic society. Their authors promised to explain the so-called ‘mysteries of generation’, enabling parents to propagate healthy, vigorous, patriotic, and politically moderate children for the Napoleonic state. Often written by outsiders to the Paris medical establishment, these manuals appealed to an engaged reading public who wanted to raise new French citizens attached to the principles of 1789 but who were opposed to radical Jacobinism, reactionary royalism, and religious revivalism. These readers (primarily women, if contemporary critics are to be believed) hoped to raise their children within the context of particular civic and moral values. 
  <br />
  <br />Largely secular in outlook, though not hostile to religious sentiment, these readers looked to scientific materialism and domestic paternalism to maintain patriotic virtue and republican sentiment. Medicine thus provided a common, ‘objective’ language to discuss divisive political and social questions. As the analysis further demonstrates, however, these reproductive manuals fit into a long-standing Enlightenment tradition of medical books about sex and reproduction, many which were hilarious, subversive, and pornographic in scope in tone. In this manner, the reproductive manuals of the Consulate and Empire toyed with erotic traditions that undermined the conservative values they sought to maintain.

  <br />Abstract: In economics classes, we teach our students that deregulation, free trade agreements and open markets are the keys to unfettered economic success, but what are the social, cultural and personal consequences when a small handful of massive media conglomerates control most of the information the American public reads, sees and hears? 
  <br />
  <br />Taking the Walt Disney Company as an example, we'll discuss the ways people and corporations meet, what happens in those interactions and why.

  <br />Abstract: The Water of the West Initiative (WoW Initiative) was awarded on April 17, 2006. The WoW Initiative will launch a Water Resources Graduate Program (WR Program) in an innovative direction that will lead the region in the education and training of tomorrow’s water resources professionals. This program will facilitate research and education to influence both the scientific understanding of the resource and how it is managed, and advance the decision-making processes that are the means to address competing societal values. We will highlight the five elements in the WoW Initiative: (1) an integrative problem-solving framework; (2) broadening WR education; (3) new faculty necessary to bring a concurrent J.D. degree into the WR Program and strengthen the Law, Policy, and Management option area of the WR Program; (4) administrative structure of the program; and (5) graduate student assistantships. Collectively, the WoW Initiative will provide the resources to launch the proposed WR Program. The WoW Initiative has the support of six colleges at the UI: Agricultural &amp; Life Sciences; Engineering; Law; Science; Letters, Arts &amp; Social Sciences; and Natural Resources. It is a university-wide initiative strengthened by collaboration with the Idaho Water Resources Research Institute.

  <br />Abstract: Road building, or highway engineering, has long been the responsibility of civil engineers. Over the past thirty years, road building has morphed into transportation, a domain that involves not just engineers but professionals from a wide range of disciplines. I will share three example projects which were eventually successful largely because of the interdisciplinary teams that were brought together to work on them: (1) not building the Mt Hood Freeway in Portland, Oregon during the 1970's, (2) expanding the capacity of transportation systems using technology in the 1990's, and (3) transportation at the edge of Moscow, Idaho in the early part of the 21st century.

  <br />ABSTRACT: Humans are playful alone, in groups, or as whole societies. We play role-playing games, board games, videogames, games of chance, sports; we dance. We play with musical instruments, paint, string, sticks, stones, and language. While we define and choose our play, play may also define us, for play is embedded in and reflects our cultures’ values, histories, and structures. Because play potentially evokes intense, personal engagement and stimulates the imagination, it can enhance teaching, learning, creativity, and discovery. It can also help balance professional activities with less intellectualized life pursuits and energize solutions for social, scientific, and artistic problems. Although it may support injustice and incivility, play has the potential to foster social cohesion and connection, compassion, and inclusiveness. This Humanities program will explore the nature, history, and uses of play--the power of play--to shape, transform, celebrate, delight or diminish individuals, institutions, and societies, and to enrich our personal, social, and professional lives.

  <br />Abstract: If something could connect the otherwise disparate fields of nineteenth-century economics, maritime history, Brazilian studies, Crimean war studies, Melville scholarship, equestrian literature, Mormon history, and immigration policy it might be the life of Captain John Codman (1814-1900). Largely forgotten, John Codman—a Bostonian sea captain and author—cast a long and impressive shadow on the nineteenth century. His was a household name. But following the front page story in the New York Times that reported his death, Codman’s legacy has, at best, been squared away into footnotes, and at worst, vanished. I am preparing to write his biography, In History’s Shadow and will present a slide-show and lecture that highlights my project.

  <br />Abstract: Symmetry plays an important role in many disciplines including art, science and engineering. Over the last two centuries, a great deal of mathematics has been developed to tackle problems in these fields. At the same time that mathematics has enhanced our understanding of symmetry, symmetry has enhanced our understanding of mathematics. This interplay will be explored.

  <br />Abstract: Mt. Kailash (22,028 ft, 6714 m) in western Tibet is the most sacred mountain and pilgrimage destination for Hindus and Tibetan Buddhists. For these two religions, this glacier covered mountain is the “navel of the world.” Completing the kora—the pilgrimage—around this holy, unclimbed mountain is said to erase the sins of a lifetime (or even many, many lifetimes). In September and October, 2006, I traveled from Kathmandu, Nepal, to Mount Kailash: a trip that involved 4 days of driving about 1100 km (700 miles) over the Himalaya and then across “the roof of the world” through western Tibet. On the three-day pilgrimage around Mt. Kailash, I hiked with Tibetan and Indian pilgrims over Drolma Pass (18,200, 5550m) and visited various monasteries along with other holy sites. In this presentation, I’ll show photos from this trip, discuss the pilgrimage in terms of Tibetan Buddhism, and touch on the political situation in Tibet.

  <br />Abstract: The trends in electronic products are toward miniaturization and increased circuit density. These trends necessitates high density interconnects. Among the packaging technologies such as laminate, ceramic, and thin film, low temperature cofired ceramics (LTCC) offer an excellent combination of properties for RF/microwave applications as well as for high speed digital products. Some of the key properties include the ability to create three dimensional interconnections with high conductivity, the capability of embedding passives, high thermal conductivity, low dielectric loss, and hermeticity. However, to date many vendors are still primarily using vias larger than 100 microns in diameter. Previous work by the researchers, as well as by others, has demonstrated the ability to form microvias as small as 50 microns in LTCC. 
  <br />
  <br />Some limited work has also been reported on the fill process for these vias using primarily silver inks. Optimization of this fill process using both gold and silver inks is critical for the wide spread adoption of microvias in high volume LTCC manufacturing lines. This presentation will report on the capability and process for filling microvia interconnects below 100&micro;m as well as the capabilities for alignment of green tape layers during the stacking operation for both silver and gold conductors. The critical process parameters for mechanically punching and filling 50 and 75 &micro;m vias will be discussed. The impact of punch handling at installation will also be addressed along with the installation of punch tooling. Via quality of the green punched layers addressing the potential for slugs as well as cross sections of fired vias will also presented. The electrical performance of the surface components as well as the embedded microvia connected components has been documented. The 75 &micro;m via geometry resulted in no continuity defects while some isolated failures were associated with the 50 &micro;m geometries. The alignment error of via stacks among the printed layers appears to be less than 25 &micro;m though misalignment on the order of 30 to 50 &micro;m was noted between the unprinted and printed layers.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: The Idaho dairy industry is the 4th largest in the nation and a significant economic force contributing 11.5% of the state's gross domestic product in 2005. Milk produced on the farm is typically sold to food processors as a commodity with bonuses paid for milk &quot;quality,&quot; based upon composition. Recently, some processors have begun to sell dairy products labeled as &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;rbST-free,&quot; and some grocery chains are requiring milk to be &quot;rbST-free.&quot; 
  <br />
  <br />To many consumers, the presence of these labels suggests that the product is of higher quality or provides greater health benefits, particularly if one notices the price on the shelf. As such, this labeling has caused some to question the health and safety of conventional milk. These labels, however, refer to agricultural practices and choices made by farmers and food producers - not necessarily to the healthfulness or safety of the product. Indeed, substantial published refereed research clearly demonstrates that neither &quot;organic&quot; nor &quot;rbST-free&quot; milk is different from conventional milk. 
  <br />
  <br />In other words, as far as scientists and analytical chemists can tell, products produced conventionally are the same as those produced &quot;organically&quot; or without the use of rbST. Thus, although there may be other implications of organic or rbST-free milk production, carrying labels as such only creates the illusion that the product provides additional nutrients or is safer. Indeed, dairy management practices are poorly understood by society. This should not be a surprise, as less than 0.1% of the U.S. population is involved in milk production and processing. For example, some interested in &quot;organic&quot; milk believe they are supporting a more sustainable, family-farm approach to dairying. Yet the reality is that two commercial companies represent 80% of the organic retail space in grocery stores. 
  <br />
  <br />Scientists need to clarify that these labels are not founded on health and safety issues but have been created to provide consumers with an indication of a handful of agricultural and industrial practices used in the production of the milk. This likely occurs at the expense of the lion's share of dairy producers (mostly family farm-based businesses), as little money is actually paid to the producer for accepting management strategies (such as denying the use of rbST or implementing &quot;organic&quot; practices) that limit profitability. Accuracy in labeling is of economic significance to the consumer as well because the retailer can charge higher milk prices based on an inaccurate or misleading labels providing no benefit to the consumer. Thus, labeling of milk should be based upon a scientific need rather than for the marketing advantage of the processor or grocer.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Though some have called habit a &quot;dead metaphor,&quot; it certainly seems to be the new It-term in self-improvement. In recent years, a virtual cottage industry of self-help books based on the concept of habit has sprung up. Stephen Covey's The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People is probably the most familiar of these, but it is only one of dozens that promise to either rid their readers of &quot;bad&quot; habits (smoking, procrastination, eating too much sugar, etc.) or to help them develop &quot;good&quot; ones. With their focus on habit, these popular books present an interesting view of identity and the self. Far from being something transcendental and enduring, identity is presented in habit-based self-help books as something plastic, something that can be broken down into component parts, then re-modulated and retrained. And the retraining itself has a specific purpose-with the help of these books, individuals learn techniques for inserting themselves more smoothly into the operations of what has been called 'late capitalism' or 'the new economy.'&quot; I contrast these purpose-driven notions of habit with a vision of a more ethical self-one in which habit is used as a means to develop the capacity to respond fully and authentically to the world.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: People expect natural resource systems to provide an array of ecological and environmental goods, services, and values as well as food and fiber commodities. Policies that harmoniously balance environmental conservation and economic development of resources to meet human needs are necessary but elusive. The sustained yield commodity production goal that served land and resource managers for centuries evolved following the 1987 international call for sustainable development. A more fully integrated “sustainability” approach will be next. 
  <br />
  <br />Toward that end, the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability can be assessed using scientific methods, but integration remains problematic. Biologist E.O. Wilson’s Consilience (1998) took a step, arguing for synthesis of knowledge; I continue in that direction. The larger the spatial scale at which one conceives sustainable resource management, the more difficult the quest becomes. When coupled with ecological and economic dimensions, stakeholders’ perceptions of the fairness of resource management proposals can help identify paths toward sustainability. Inclusive forums where stakeholders interact with land and resource managers in collaborative learning exercises can be an appropriate starting point, but durable issues remain: Who represents future generations? How can broad social perspectives be reconciled with local concerns?

  <br />Abstract: During the Triassic Period, 240 million years ago, most of the continental land mass was part of one giant continent that stretched from pole to pole. This geography created an enormous climate system, called the Pangean megamonsoon, that affected climate worldwide. The climate was marked by strong seasonality, especially in precipitation. Geologists have documented the evolution of this climate system using rocks, fossils, geochemistry, and climate modeling. Although we understand many aspects of the climate well, some mysteries remain.

  <br />Abstract: Climate change would affect southern Idaho irrigation water supplies. While the effects might be climate change-driven, the actual irrigation impacts would be mediated by basin hydrology, water storage and control infrastructure, institutional arrangements governing water use and allocation, changes to competing demands for power generation and in-stream flows, and farmer reactions to changing water supplies. The basin hydrology is simulated by means of a snowmelt runoff model, SRM, to estimate changes to the timing and magnitude of the inflow from watersheds into the river system. MODSIM is used to simulate reservoir operation and prior-appropriation doctrine water allocation given the hydrologic inputs. Modeled inflow changes are based on simulated snowmelt runoff changes resulting from climate change scenarios referenced to the years 2030 and 2080. For each of these reference time frames, results from three different General Circulation Models (GCMs) were implemented, representing the range of &quot;Wet&quot;, &quot;Middle&quot;, and &quot;Dry&quot; conditions simulated by all the models included in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for the mid-range (A1B) emissions scenario. Modsim model results include both the average and time-distribution of expected irrigation water shortages by river reach and tributary within the Snake River Basin. 
  <br />
  <br />Presently water supplies in the basin are abundant, and storage and distribution systems are robust, so water shortage is significant only in occasional dry years. Our results indicate that climate change may have either a beneficial or deleterious effect on the supply of agricultural irrigation water. The models corresponding to the &quot;Wet&quot; and &quot;Middle&quot; (i.e., average or median) climate change scenarios both indicate that there will be a surplus of water relative to current climate conditions. Even though the simulated runoff occurs somewhat earlier in the melt season, the existing system of reservoirs is sufficient to provide a surplus of water even in the dry summer months. The &quot;Dry&quot; model scenarios for 2030 and 2080 both produced a small deficit in irrigation water supply, which basin-wide amount to 1.7% and 2.7%, respectively, of the delivery provided by the current climate. 
  <br />
  <br />These shortages are not uniformly distributed across the basin. Instead, they are increased or decreased at specific locations or nodes corresponding to end-users throughout the basin as a result of complex interactions among the amount and timing of runoff, water rights seniority of the end-users, and the spatial distribution of storage and transport infrastructure throughout the system. Despite the deficit to water supply resulting from the most extreme climate change scenario, the supply functions which provide the price-quantity relationships for water in the system were virtually identical between the baseline current climate, and the worst-case 2080-Dry scenario. Increased water demands for downstream and in-stream uses, such as hydropower and endangered salmon passage, could make the impact much greater, which would also be true in the present climate.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: In the past 15 years, our knowledge of the solar system has increased significantly. Many large bodies in the Kuiper Belt and beyond have been discovered. Just a year ago, in light of these discoveries, the International Astronomical Union voted to &quot;demote&quot; Pluto from planet to &quot;dwarf planet&quot;. Many described this move as reflecting our discovery of Pluto's proper categorization. I argue that things are nowhere near this simple. We might better regard it as a classificatory decision. Many interesting questions arise from this stance (what constrains such decisions? what do they reflect about the objects so classified?). Perhaps we can learn from another protracted episode of the taxonomic confusion: the furor surrounding the platypus.

  <br />Scott Wood - Geological Sciences 
  <br />
  <br />Abstract: How asbestiform minerals evolve by reaction in the lung remains poorly understood. It is well known that the proportion of amphibole to chrysotile asbestos found in the lungs of miners and millers is generally much higher than in the material to which they were exposed. This phenomenon is normally explained by either more effective clearance mechanisms or lower biodurability (faster dissolution) of chrysotile in the lungs, both explanations being reasonable. 
  <br />
  <br />The goals of our study are twofold; 1) determine the rate of dissolution of tremolite asbestos in simulated lung fluid (Gamble's solution) as a function of pH and organic ligand concentration in order to compare with previous measurements of the dissolution rate of chrysotile; and 2) use geochemical modeling techniques to determine whether transformations of chrystotile or tremolite to other minerals are thermodynamically possible in the lungs. Our dissolution rate measurements confirm that the dissolution rate of tremolite is several orders of magnitude lower than that of chrysotile under lung conditions at similar pH. They also show that some carboxylic acids in Gamble's solution can increase the rate of dissolution of tremolite substantially. Our thermodynamic and kinetic modeling suggests that, especially under closed or nearly closed conditions, phases such as amorphous silica, talc, carbonates and hydroxylapatite could form from either tremolite or chrysotile. To our knowledge, this is the first time that transformation of asbestiform minerals to another mineral form has been suggested and could have important implications for treatment and prognosis of asbestos-related diseases.

  <br />Abstract: The NASA Galileo mission to Jupiter in 1995 heralded a new era in the exploration of the outer solar system. For the first time, a planetary probe entered, descended under parachute, and directly sampled an atmosphere in the outer solar system. In 2004 the NASA/European Space Agency Cassini orbiter and probe arrived at Saturn, and in January, 2005 the European Space Agency Huygens probe descended to the surface of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon. Titan is a world with remarkable parallels to the Earth. Although much colder than Earth, Titan possesses a dense Nitrogen atmosphere, and, besides Earth, is the only body in the solar system with a surface comprising both solid ground and lakes. 
  <br />
  <br />Shrouded in a global haze evidencing a sophisticated hydrocarbon chemistry, the surface of Titan cannot be seen in visible light and, until Huygens’ arrival, had not been well studied. Throughout the descent of the Huygens probe, the structure, chemistry, and dynamics of Titan’s atmosphere were directly sampled and studied, and the surface of Titan imaged. How do we benefit from these Gigadollar (multi-billion dollar) space ventures, and what can detailed studies of the planets tell us about Earth? In this talk I will present both the Galileo mission to Jupiter and the Cassini mission to Saturn and Titan, with a particular emphasis on the atmospheric probes, and I will discuss how knowledge gained from planetary exploration translates into a better understanding of Earth’s atmosphere, weather, chemistry, history, and, possibly, future..

  <br />Abstract: What course is more reviled by college students than the introductory statistics course? Why are departments of statistics less common than other science departments at research universities? Why do graduate students (not to mention, professors!) in many disciplines confess insecurity, apprehension, and confusion about the statistical analyses in their research? Why do so many university departments try to teach their own statistics courses? This presentation will explore these questions in relation to the unique interdisciplinary role of statistics in modern life. The presentation will offer an opportunity for the university community to discuss the future of statistics at UI.

  <br />Abstract: Hopefully, this title might pique the curiosity of those who think I just study rocks (actually, I study minerals!). My interest in this subject stems from a lecture I prepared for Geology 101 back in the early 90’s titled “Asbestos: A metaphor for risk perception.” That lecture grew into a seminar and later a publication in the Journal of Geoscience Education. Asbestos is the fibrous form of certain minerals and thus occurs naturally. All of us breathe thousands of asbestos fibers every day, yet many have heard the phrase and believe that “one fiber you kill you.” Numerous civil lawsuits have been argued on this point. I have discussed the health effects of mineral dusts in an integrated science course taught in the mid 1990’s, an honors class in risk perception, and a core integrated science class on minerals and human health. 
  <br />
  <br />The thread that runs through this issue is that we, as humans, have an inherent trait that makes it difficult for us to ascertain real from imagined risks. For instance, we fear flying and will often drive to avoid the perceived increased risk of flying. Sadly, these sorts of decisions kill us. A prime example of this is the fact that Americans shunned air travel after the events of 9/11/2001 and the result was a significant increase in the number of deaths from auto accidents. I will discuss several other similar examples along with the cold hard facts of what we will die from and how there is often an inverse correlation between what will kill us and what we fear we kill us. Last, I will offer the premise that we as a society might be causing more negative health effects from stress brought on by worrying about all the insignificant risks we face on daily basis. Hopefully, you’ll leave this talk and think more about how much you eat and how far you drive your car and stop worrying about bird flu, mad cow disease, or tainted spinach!

  <br />Abstract: Aid to developing countries totals in the billions of dollars and nearly every major industrialized country has a government agency that provides assistance to poorer countries, with projects focused on health, governance, education, economic development, and the environment. Women in Development or WID and Gender and Development or GAD, initiated in the 70’s and 80’s, critiqued development for maintaining gender inequalities. Their proposal to mainstream gender challenged development organizations to integrate women into all aspects of development. Gender analysis tools were developed to assist organizations in mainstreaming gender. One tool called a gender audit, would help organizations reduce once and for all, the inequalities that continued, through in-depth self-assessment. This is the study of one gender audit process conducted in the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) office in Dhaka Bangladesh from June 2003 through July 2004. 
  <br />
  <br />The goal of the study is to gain a greater understanding of how a gender audit actually helps an organization to mainstream gender. What does a gender audit offer an organization? Using case study methods and a qualitative research approach, data generation and analysis utilizes Atlas.ti computer software to develop a full story of this gender audit process. In-depth interviews were conducted with participants of the gender audit process. With little published research on the effectiveness of gender audits and no other completed audits within the USAID system of more than 100 global offices, this study attempts to fill a gap for academics and development practitioners. It offers a thorough exploration of the literature and theory related to gender audits, and will provide recommendations about potential uses of a revised gender audit process for USAID. Finally, the study will help us to understand how a gender audit aids an organization to mainstream gender.

  <br />Abstract: Global oil reserves are in decline, markets are becoming more competitive, many of the oil producing countries are becoming unstable and global warming issues are looming large on the horizon. As these problems escalate and diesel prices exceed three dollars a gallon in the U.S., biodiesel is getting unprecedented attention. Biodiesel from vegetable oils has been shown to be the best supplement to fossil-based fuels due to environmental advantages, renewable resource availability, and ability to lessen the dependence on imported oils. Biodiesel is one of the hottest topics globally. What so good about biodiesel? Can it be all biodiesel? What is the status of biodiesel production &amp; utilization in the U.S. and rest of the world?

  <br />Abstract: In many situations, people tend to be overconfident in their beliefs and judgments. In this colloquium, I will show that there are three main ways in which overconfidence has been defined and investigated. The three forms of overconfidence to be discussed are embodied in Lake Wobegon effects, over-estimation effects, and over-precision effects. Overconfidence is often associated with serious, negative behavioral consequences. Why then, is this judgment error so persistent? Overconfidence also has some positive consequences for both individuals and groups.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogenic bacterium for humans as well as a variety of animals. Recently, it has received renewed public attention because of the occurrence of highly virulent strains within communities that are resistant to methicillin. In a typical year, S. aureus causes up to 9 million treated human infections with an economic impact of nearly $7 million. In addition, S. aureus is the leading agent of bovine mastitis, an infectious disease that causes $2 billion in lost revenue to the dairy industry in the U.S. alone. 
  <br />
  <br />We have been interested in understanding the role of protein exotoxins produced by staphylococci and related organisms. In particular, a group of toxins known as superantigens are recognized for their large-scale activation of the immune system. This property is responsible for their ability to cause a serious disease known as toxic shock syndrome as well as staphylococcal food poisoning. Interestingly, many strains of S. aureus, including those that colonize humans and animals, produce one or more superantigens. Considering their widespread occurrence, we have been exploring the hypothesis that 'superantigen production by bacteria causes an effect on the immune system that down regulates local immunity and promotes colonization and/or persistence'. 
  <br />
  <br />Using a variety of animal models, we have confirmed that the toxins repress the immune response, including to S. aureus. Several cell types, consistent with immunosuppression, are induced in vitro and in vivo. In addition, bacteria that express superantigens are more able to colonize and cause infections compared to isogenic strains in which the toxin genes are deleted. Combined, these results indicate that a selective advantage is provided to bacteria capable of expressing superantigens. The well-known ability of superantigens to induce severe shock-like symptoms in toxic shock syndrome and other adverse effects are likely secondary effects of the immunosuppression. The occurrence of these severe secondary effects also suggests that S. aureus likely acquired these toxin genes relatively recently. If so, it is also likely that further co-evolution of the bacteria with their respective hosts will lead to toxins that are more efficient at inducing immunosuppression and less likely to induce shock.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Money may not grow on trees, but chocolate does...and chocolate is big business. In 2004, the world consumed almost 12 billion pounds of chocolate confections, 29% of which was consumed by Americans at an average of almost 12 pounds of chocolate per person per year. The source of this gustatory delight, the chocolate tree (Theobroma cacao), originated in the upper Amazon basin, but is grown for commercial chocolate production in tropical regions around the globe. It is a small, broad-leaved, evergreen botanical wonder that is very particular about temperature and moisture, grows best in the damp and shaded understory of tropical rainforests, and generally refuses to produce its seed-containing pods beyond 20&ordm; from the equator. Its flowers are pollinated by midges that live in litter beneath the forest canopy. 
  <br />
  <br />Chocolate trees can be grown sustainably under the shade of taller fruit-producing trees, such as citrus species, but they are often grown in single-species production plantations where native forests have been cleared, where large doses of fertilizer and pesticides are used on a regular basis, and where slave and child labor reduce costs to candy producers who sell chocolate confections at very low prices. This presentation will examine T. cacao through a variety of lenses...from seed to confection...from the &quot;botany of desire&quot; to the social implications of indulgence.

  <br />Abstract: University research is a key component in our nation's innovative capacity. However, the process of moving technologies from the research laboratory to the marketplace is often inefficient and complex after sponsored funding ends. The sponsored funding provides initial support to formulate and test the idea, but falls short of a funding period for testing and revision of workable prototypes. Our intent is to introduce the idea of gap funding or &quot;proof of concept&quot; funding via support through the UI Foundation. The Idaho Innovation Fund would support researchers in analysis of the business idea via a collaborative effort with the Vandal Innovation and Enterprise Works (VIEW) Entrepreneurship Program and the UI Office of Technology Transfer.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Even though death is inevitable, it could be argued that it is not universal. For example, whereas French people are seemingly incredibly clumsy, Americans are world-renown for their blood-thirst (lethal non-motor vehicle accident rates in France are close to double that of the United States, while homicide rates in the U.S. can be as much as ten times those of France). Having spent some time with the dead in France and in the United States, the author has begun to disentangle the complex net of constructions at play in mortality statistics. In doing so, she has had to put on a variety of disciplinary hats, be they from the legal field, political science, medicine, sociology, anthropology, criminology, or psychology. Some may have fit better than others, but in the end, the answer was clear: Dead people do speak different languages.

  <br />Abstract: The Hammond Organ sound has become an icon in the world of Rock and Jazz music. It is as popular today as it has ever been. While it is easy to replicate &quot;the sound&quot; today using sophisticated Digital Signal Processing, &quot;back in the day&quot; (the 1930's!) the sound was created electromechanically and amplified with tubes. Many people are familiar with the sounds, but they don't understand or appreciate the very &quot;old school&quot; technology used in their creation (motors, tonewheels and tube amps!). We will discuss the history of the original technology, focusing on the original Hammond tonewheel organ, and continue the history through the keyboards of today.

  <br />Abstract: Aleister Crowley, the self-proclaimed Great Beast 666, attained his greatest fame, or infamy, as the preeminent occultist of the 20th century. However, Crowley also played another, and heretofore unappreciated, role during his long career (1875-1947): informer, provocateur and all-around asset for British intelligence. Professor Spence will describe how he negotiated the peculiarities and pitfalls of researching in a &quot;culture of secrecy&quot;--intelligence agencies and occult organizations--to reveal Crowley's hidden exploits. He'll also discuss how Crowley's activities fit a wider pattern of intertwining connections between the occult and secret services.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: The Fate of Lead and Zinc in Soils Down-river from Mining Occurring in the Coeur d’Alene River Valley The lower Coeur d’Alene (CDA) River Basin floodplain lies downstream of Idaho’s historic Silver Valley, one of the richest lead and silver mining regions in the world, and now one of the largest Superfund sites in the U.S. The Basin encompasses 19,200 acres, of which 95% have Pb, As, Cd, and Zn concentrations that exceed the EPA’s cleanup criteria, due to alluvial deposition of mine tailings and mill wastes. Contaminants in the soils have caused waterfowl mortality, decreases in aquatic species populations and diversity, and metal leaching to river and groundwater. The region hosts rural communities, includes tribal lands, several thousand acres of agriculture land, and is a recreational attraction. Thus metal-contaminated soils within the CDA Basin pose significant human exposure risks. 
  <br />
  <br />In this presentation an overview of the contaminant cycling in the soils developing in the CDA basin will be presented. Because soils are integral components of the ecosystem, the fate of the contaminants and potential toxicity is dependent on their speciation in the soils. In the soil chemistry laboratory we are currently investigating the speciation of Pb and Zn in these soils, and assessing their relative solubility, which controls transport and bio-uptake. We are discovering that Pb and Zn are intimately associated with iron and manganese oxide solid phases. Our results will allow land and resource managers to do better risk management and more efficiently implement remediation.

  <br />Randall Teal - Art &amp; Architecture 
  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Architectural drawing did not fully emerge until the Renaissance. When it did, it proved to be beneficial to architects because it allowed them to explore and develop building designs on paper before anything was actually built. However, this “progress” also had its drawbacks, in that it also enabled designers to become detached from the buildings they were representing. As a consequence, bodily experience of the built environment was frequently forgotten. The effects of this loss can still be felt today in our cities which are regularly populated by objects that are less buildings than they are built drawings. Following in this legacy it becomes important that designers remember that a building is a three dimensional space for human encounter and not merely a formal composition. 
  <br />
  <br />Reestablishing human encounter in architectural representation begins with an understanding that when people enter a place, they experience it primarily as a mood in which they are immersed, and only secondarily as the actual elements that comprise this mood. Drawing on writings in philosophy and architectural theory, as well as examples of exercises that I use in my architectural studio courses, I will explore the challenges presented by architectural representation, and how mood can easily get lost when representation and building become undifferentiated in the designer’s mind. I will also suggest how viewing architecture as an embodied experience or atmosphere points the way toward a more holistic way of approaching design.

  <br />Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries continue to be one of the most common knee injuries in the United States, resulting in healthcare costs in the billions for surgery and rehabilitation alone. And yet, with 20 years of research on ACL injuries, we still understand little about the exact causes of these injuries. The good news is that even with our lack of understanding about specific causes, several promising training programs have been developed to prevent ACL injuries. During this session, we will discuss the causes of ACL injuries and the characteristics of good prevention programs.

  <br />Ian Chambers - History 
  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Historian and theorist Henri Lefebvre has written that even if there is no general code of space, inherent to language or to all languages, there may have existed specific codes, established at specific historical periods and varying in their effects. If so interested ‘subjects’, as members of a particular society, would have acceded by this means at once to their space and to their status as ‘subjects’ acting within that space and (in the broadest sense of the word) comprehending it. 
  <br />
  <br />Building on Lefebvre, and other theorists, I have developed the concept of ‘spatial persona,’ that is, the linkage of a person’s identification with a specific location, or locations, as a means of verifying identity and informing the act of contact. My paper examines the development of the British spatial persona in the early eighteenth century, as seen through the works of Daniel Defoe. I initially turn to Defoe’s Tour, selecting several moments to detail the British spatial persona in the metropolis. I then travel across the Atlantic to show how the British spatial persona was played out during the colonial experience, both in fiction as seen in Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and in the real-life experiences of British settlers in the American Southeast as seen in the following quotation from Philip Thicknese, a British colonist who briefly settled in the new colony of Georgia in 1736, and commented in his memoirs: 
  <br />
  <br />
  <em>the Indians sometimes visited my Island for a day or two, and then I had plenty of venison, which they boil’d down, and eat dipped in wild honey, this was a true Robinson Crusoe line of life. Philip Thicknesse. *</em>

  <br />Steve Chandler, English and Neuroscience 
  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Linguistics is the study of the nature of language. As a psycholinguist, I am particularly interested in trying to understand how language is acquired and represented in the brain. The predominant theories of how language is represented in the brain posit acquisitional processes in which the brain abstracts generalizations about one's language away from instances of linguistic experience and forms physical, neurological, representations of those generalizations. Those resident linguistic generalizations become in turn the brain's basis for producing and comprehending subsequent instances of linguistic usage. That is, they become the neurological basis for speaking and understanding your language. For much of the past 20 years, I have participated in a research group that posits a very different view of the nature of linguistic generalizations. Rather than positing resident linguistic generalizations that have been abstracted away from one's linguistic experiences, the Analogical Model posits that throughout one's lifetime people simply accumulate memories for instances of linguistic experiences. Their subsequent use of the language-whether production or comprehension-involves comparing the current communicative act with that collection of instances of previously experienced communicative acts and identifying-on the fly-one or more patterns inherent in that collection which best interprets or achieves the current communicative act. Our reading of the research literature is that the empirical evidence continues to confirm the predictions of the Analogical Model over those of the competing theories.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Export enhancement and import substitution are both commonly employed community economic development strategies. The treatment of import substitution has been less rigorous with this strategy relegated to folk economic and qualitative treatments. This presentation describes both strategies symmetrically in both the Leontief and Keynesian models. It is found, predicated on the assumptions of the models and on the existence of unrealized comparative advantages in the regional economy, that import substitution is at least as good an economic development strategy as export enhancement. For either large changes or the cumulative effects of small ones, import substitution creates more economic activity.

  <br />Abstract: How do we come to understand the infinite? After pondering some paradoxes together, we'll briefly trace the development of human thinking about infinity from Zeno's day to Cantor's. We'll examine how this development illuminates the cognitive moves that learners must make in order to negotiate the pitfalls of the infinite, including the metaphors of object-creation and their accompanying ontological anxiety.

  <br />Abstract: Insects kill vast numbers of trees in Idaho, the United States, and North America. Climate change, in the form of higher temperatures and drought, is one driver of these outbreaks. The severity and extent of these disturbances imply large impacts to exchanges of carbon between the land and atmosphere, which lead to effects on future climate change. In this talk, I will describe research to establish the influence of climate on outbreaks of mountain pine beetle outbreaks, the insect that causes the most extensive tree mortality in the West. I will also discuss studies to quantify the impacts of these killed trees on atmospheric carbon dioxide and thus future climate change. A better understanding of the future of these forest disturbances and their impacts will improve decision-making of land managers, policymakers, and the public on Western forest issues.

  <br />Rosanna Lauriola - Classics, History
  <br />&nbsp;
  <br />Abstract: One of the on-going debates on ancient Greek Literature is that pertaining to Aristophanes’ comedy. What is the aim of the invectives leveled against prominent members of 5th century Athenian society in a genre which is expected to make people laugh is the question most debated by scholars, when they ask whether Aristophanes is to be taken seriously in his attacks on the contemporary politicians (the demagogue Cleon and other corrupt leaders), on the tragic poet Euripides, on the rival comic playwrights, on the new intellectuals (the Sophists) and their fellows. 
  <br />
  <br />The debate has produced a polarized view, in that some scholars tend to see a complete identification of comedy and politics, others a complete divorce. Hence for some, Aristophanes’ comedy was intended to have a strong effect on the political and social status of Athens, by promoting a civic awareness of the surrounding reality, for others Aristophanes meant only to amuse and to grant, through his fantastic inventions, a means of evading reality by freeing the audience’s mind from pressure and anxiety. Similar polarized view is applied to the invectives Aristophanes expressed against the contemporary comic playwrights. Indeed, despite the variety of Aristophanes’ targets, scholars mostly tend to focus on politicians and comic playwrights, and they thus tend to discuss the issue of Aristophanes’ seriousness with reference to these categories of persons. 
  <br />
  <br />On the basis of some statements of the poet himself, whose voice is often recognizable as surfacing behind a character throughout the comedy, it actually seems that Aristophanes’ comedy is by purpose ‘serious-comic’(spoudaiogeloion), in that it aims not simply to provoke laughter; indeed it aims to promote in the citizens some kind of self-criticism and awareness through laughter. Thereby, the serious component of Aristophanes’ plays can be regarded as a pervasively embedded trait, inseparable from humor. Moreover, it concerns not only politicians and comic playwrights, but all the other persons whose actions are perceived by Aristophanes as responsible for the crisis of the contemporary Athens. One of the strategies that Aristophanes uses to realize a ‘serious-comic’ poetry is a subtle and witty use of specific terminology (lexicon) that consists of laughable (geloion) words, or, still better, words that are meant to provoke mere laughter only on the surface, while communicating serious concerns and criticism (spoudaion). 
  <br />
  <br />So far existing scholarship has emphasized a specific trait of Aristophanes’ lexicon, that is the occurrence of terms that the poet would used as catchwords to specifically address his criticism to circumscribed categories of persons that constitute his typical targets. Hence one can speak of a lexicon pertaining to Aristophanes’ literary criticism of the comic and tragic playwrights, or of a lexicon pertaining to his criticism of prominent figures of the polis’ administration, etc. Beside this undoubted trait of Aristophanes’ lexicon, there is, however, another trait that has received little attention: the use of the same kind of words to qualify, to the same degree, different categories of persons, words that are laughable on surface, yet able to communicate a precise serious criticism, which is always the same independently from the individual target.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Native American communities aiming to construct tribal architectures face a variety of challenges. Some are related to underlying issues of discourse and scholarship. Scholars have written very little critical literature about 20th- and 21st-century Native American architecture. Architectural education is based on a European model and rarely includes Native American architecture. These conditions result in additional issues related to practice. Very few Native American people practice within the profession of architecture. As a result, most design professionals are non-Native. Because these architects have fundamentally different worldviews and styles of communication, cross-cultural communication is often a challenge for both architects and clients. Authority on architecture for tribal communities can be ambiguous. Other issues include administrative barriers and the challenges of creating meaningful tribally-specific architectures when there is no system of translating historical built forms into contemporary architecture.

  <br />Abstract: Several regional land use conflicts have emerged over the last decade, deeply dividing the communities of Moscow and Pullman. These conflicts can be framed as both differences in economic perspectives and cultural clashes. Both themes will be explored in selected local issues, including the proposals to build two super Wal-Marts on the Palouse and the Hawkins development. These have broader national and international implications. Finally, a brief look at the current state of the Palouse economy will be presented along with prospects for the future.

  <br />Abstract: Natural evolution has generated an amazing array of organisms to solve the very difficult problems associated with survival. Using a computer to imitate the fundamental aspect of evolution: reproduction, inheritance, and selection, it is possible to harness the evolutionary process to evolve solutions to complex problems. Because of its generality artificial evolution has been applied to a wide range of problems, from robotic navigation, to the generation of cooperation, to games, and even the creation of art. In this presentation I will present a few of the applications of artificial evolution being pursued at the University of Idaho.

  <br />&nbsp;
  <br />Abstract: Research on communication dynamics has shown that human beings, across nations and cultures, ‘talk’ to each other using facial and voiced expressions, gestures, body language and of course, by listening. In fact, facial expressions can be as much as 70% of the information (content) that is transmitted and received. Further, it’s likely that the ‘state-of-being’, ‘state-of-mind’ or ‘emotional state’ is expressed via communication; that is, facial and voiced expressions can directly represent human emotions. Most of us ‘understand’ facial and voiced expressions effortlessly. 
  <br />
  <br />With the recent accessibility of digital images and audio, the speaker and his students realized a natural foray into the social sciences using ‘tools’ well-developed in the digital signal process engineering. The ‘team’ developed an initial multi-modal emotion recognition system using cues from digitally recorded facial images and voiced recordings. This is achieved by extracting features from each of the modalities using signal processing techniques, and then classifying these features with the help of artificial neural networks (ANN). The features extracted from the face are the eyes, eyebrows, mouth and nose; this is done using image processing techniques such as seeded region growing algorithm, particle swarm optimization and general properties of the feature being extracted. In contrast, features of interest in speech are pitch, frequencies and spectra along with some statistical properties and also the rate of change of these properties. These features are extracted using techniques such as Fourier transform. 
  <br />
  <br />In the course of research the team developed a toolbox that can read an audio and/or video file and ‘perform emotion recognition’ on the face in the video and speech in the audio channel. The features extracted from the face and voices are independently classified into emotions using two separate feed forward types of ANNs. This toolbox then presents the output of the artificial neural networks from one/both the modalities on a synchronized time scale. Some interesting results from this research is consistent misclassification of facial expressions between two databases (one European, one Asian), suggesting a cultural basis for this misinterpretation. Addition of voice component has been shown to partially help in better classification.

  <br />Abstract: This presentation is designed to exam, in an introductory way, how the knowledge of language and particularly its prehistory, can illuminate our knowledge of cultural or physical prehistory (i.e., archeology). If we know what the speakers of a proto-language, an abstract entity outside of both time and space, talked about, can we connect it with a particular archeological culture, firmly root in both time and space, but mute.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: From a dietitian’s perspective, what happens to food from the field to the table has significant implications for our health. We must become aware of the connection between the dirt in the field to the food that grows in the dirt to the food on the table and to the eater, to understand the impact on our health. Many steps along the way can have a positive or negative impact on the final outcome on the health of us, our environment and our planet. Lifestyle changes implied in local, seasonal, sustainable food systems are critical in making the long terms changes needed for improved health. The fabric of the grass root movement for sustainable food systems is a key ingredient to life style change that can have long term implications for improving our health. During this session, we will begin to connect the dots between the health of our soil, our food and ourselves.

  <br />Alcohol is the number one health problem on college campuses. Excessive drinking among college students is associated with a variety of negative consequences that include fatal and nonfatal injuries; alcohol poisoning; blackouts; academic failure; violence, including rape and assault; unintended pregnancy; sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS; property damage; and career and legal consequences that could jeopardize future job prospects. A decade of data collection and research has informed and guided Institutions of Higher Education’s efforts to reduce the risk of excessive drinking among college students. This presentation will provide a summary of alcohol use by University of Idaho students and explore various interventions being implemented to reduce the consequences of high-risk drinking.

  <br />Abstract: This presentation, aimed at the undergraduate audience, will look at the hypotheses offered by the famous theoretical physicist, Stephen W. Hawking concerning radiation that might come from Black Holes. If this radiation occurs, it would mean that Black Holes are not so black after all. The talk will be a qualitative discussion (mathematics kept to a minimum) about Professor Hawking’s main ideas that come from General Relativity and Quantum Physics. Using these ideas, he creates the notion that Black Holes might radiate energy away like a hot object and evaporate! This hypothetical phenomenon is called: “Hawking Radiation.” It is also fascinating to see how Newton’s Classical Physics, Einstein’s General Relativity, and Quantum Physics each treat the idea of “vacuum” differently.

  <br /> 
  <br />ABSTRACT: 
  <br />“Women as Activists and Citizens in Lviv and Kharkiv During Ukraine’s 2004 Orange Revolution” is a collaborative endeavor with Alexandra Hrycak, associate professor of sociology at Reed College. In this project we examine women (ages 18-73) who were active in supporting the pro-West candidate Viktor Yushchenko during the 2004 Orange Revolution, a revolution that erupted as a result of corruption and fraud during Ukraine’s presidential elections. The revolution was a surprise to many who saw the Ukrainian public as passive and unperturbed by “politics as usual.” Much like this passive public, women in Ukraine have been invisible – viewed as private characters with little interest in politics and engaged citizenship. In fact, since the revolution, women have yet to feature prominently in research surrounding the Orange Revolution. Yet, our study finds that women across a variety of ages – through doing the “housework of politics” - enabled communication and mobilization for Orange revolutionary action. We find these clues through focus groups with women activists in two culturally divergent cities in Ukraine – the “pro-West” city of Lviv and the “pro-East” city of Kharkiv (conducted in 2005). Through these focus groups we find an empowered sense of women’s identities and a far less polarized vision for Ukraine’s future, despite the widespread media attention to a “divided Ukraine.” This presentation will also explore factors surrounding women’s activism and citizenship that may have led to the pro-East candidate Viktor Yanukovych’s victory in the recent 2010 presidential elections.

  <br />Abstract: Cases are commonly used to teach business concepts to business students. Cases help to create a student-centered classroom dynamic and help students understand the need for and appreciate the value of business theories, frameworks and tools as they are introduced to and asked to apply these theories, frameworks and tools. But teaching with cases is only part of the opportunity for faculty members. Writing cases represents an accepted and encouraged component of research at numerous business schools, and the process of researching and writing these cases can provide valuable outreach to regional businesses and nonprofits. Today’s presenter has worked with a number of local and regional organizations (e.g., Cowgirl Chocolates, Pacific Cataract &amp; Laser Institute, Pacific Northwest Fiber, Palouse Ice Rink Association, and The Backyard Harvest) through the case research and writing process. He will talk about the multiple opportunities that case research presents and discuss how faculty from across campus can become involved in this very rewarding form of research, teaching and outreach.

  <br />
  <br />Abstract: Prompted by the current economic crisis, the concomitant loss of faith in traditional economic institutions, and the increasing rejection of the dominant tropes of consumer capitalism (planned obsolescence, waste, convenience, efficiency, anonymity), the DIY ethic can be seen in everything from the overhaul of domestic economies (the renewed interest, especially among young people, in backyard gardens, sewing and knitting, cooking “from scratch,” barter economies, and crafting products from recycled household materials) to the rise in popularity of websites like neighborhoodfruit.org, veggietrader.com, Etsy.com and craftster.org. We look at gleaners and “upcyclers,” particular manifestations of this resurgence, both groups seeking to change their relationships to the consumption and waste that are hallmarks of late capitalist western society, both groups challenging and in some ways reinforcing dominant paradigms. We particularly wish to investigate the narratives that these practitioners construct about themselves in relation to the mainstream economy, and the communication technologies that foster the spread of these narratives.

  <h2>&quot;Flow Oscillations in Wavy Walled Tubes for Gas Separations and other Native Activities&quot;</h2> 
  <strong><br /> Aaron Thomas, Assistant Professor<br /> Chemical Engineering <br /> November 2- Idaho Commons Whitewater Room <br /> 12:30 pm</strong> 
  <br /> Abstract: This presentation begins with a brief overview of research involving oscillatory flows as a novel mechanical separation mechanism for gas species. Flow oscillations cause species that are present in a mixture to transport at different rates and thus give rise to a separation. The phenomena observed for flow oscillations in gas separations are also applied to the separation of biological materials on the microscale. Work is currently being conducted on demonstrating the separation that can be achieved on the mixtures of DNA samples with varying numbers of base pairs. Furthermore, this talk will address STEM education and the Native American/ Alaska Native communities. For many Native American/ Alaska Native students, they have lived much of their life on the reservation or in their respective villages. Moving away from a close-knit environment of family, elders, and culture to pursue higher education is a daunting proposition. Activites at the University of Idaho aimed to help recruit and retain students in higher education and the STEM fiels will be presented.&nbsp;

Most infections are linked to the consumption of contaminated undercooked ground beef or uncooked vegetables contaminated with bovine waste. O157 are ubiquitous on the farm and can survive in raw manure, soil, and water.&nbsp; Although O157 have been cultured from a variety of animals, healthy ruminants are the silent reservoir.&nbsp;&nbsp; The O157 survive passage through the ruminant gastrointestinal tract and animals can be transiently colonized with this human pathogen.&nbsp; Successful strategies to control or reduce the carriage and prevalence of O157 in cattle would reduce the risk of human disease. Ongoing research to systematically analyze the bacterial factors that contribute to the ability of O157 to colonize cattle will presented.&nbsp; Virulence factors important in clinical disease, the O-antigen, and the role of the plasmid will be included.&nbsp; In addition, insights about how the bacteria sense their environment (the farm or the gastrointestinal tract) will be discussed.&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>&quot;Willingness To Pay For Animal Welfare In Dairy Production: Evidence From Experimental Auctions&quot;</h2> 
  <p><strong>Levan Elbakidze - Assistant Professor <br /> Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology <br /> November 9 - Idaho Commons Whitewater Room <br /> 12:30 pm <br /> </strong>Abstract: Concerns pertaining to bioethics in agricultural production have been on the rise in recent years. This study uses non-hypothetical experimental auctions to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for humane animal care certified cheese and ice cream. We use 2nr price and random Nth price auctions as well as Open Ended Choice Experiments in multi-product, multi-quantity, and multi-round context. Unlike previous applications of experimental auctions this study estimates WTP for multiple quantities rather than WTP for a single unit of a given product. The results contrast participants’ bids across different auction mechanisms and different products. Differences in bidding patterns are detected between auction mechanisms as well as products. Some WTP premium price for humane animal care certified ice cream is detected. However, no WTP premium price for humane animal care certified cheese is detected. The limitations and caveats of estimation results will be discussed. </p>

  <p style=""margin-right: 0.5in;""><strong><strong>Nick Gier<br /> </strong>Professor Emeritus, Philosophy<br /> April 12- SUB Gold Room<br /> 12:30<br /> <br /> </strong>Abstract: While much work has been done on religiously motivated violence in the Abrahamic (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) religions, very little attention has been focused on the Asian religions. As with the Abrahamic religions, the fusion of religious and national identity in Hindu and Buddhist fundamentalism has led to violence committed in the name of religion. </p> 
  <p style=""margin-right: 0.5in;"">In this talk I will discuss the relations between Tibetan Buddhist lamas and secular authorities, especially those connected with Mongolian militarism. I will then focus on the problems inherent in a political philosophy based on a doctrine of reincarnated religious leaders. A case study of the Bhutanese lama-king Shabdrung (1594-1651), who at one time had three recognized incarnated descendants, demonstrates the fragility of this doctrine of political and religious legitimacy. </p> 
  <p style=""margin-right: 0.5in;"">The current Dalai Lama has been very frank about the problems of reincarnated religious leaders in Tibetan history, and his decision to break the ties between religion and politics is both courageous and wise.&nbsp; It may even pave the way for a resolution of the impasse between the Dalai Lama and the Beijing government.</p>

   <br /> Abstract: This subject reflects my research and writing and I hope it will facilitate understanding of an ancient theme:&nbsp; How to govern in accord with constitutional and legal principles (considered universal and perennial) while addressing emergencies (considered idiosyncratic and immediate) that escape or defy law.&nbsp; It’s a problem that gripped the ancient Athenians as well as the Romans, and it has been a subject of enduring interest in the Anglo-Saxon world of law.&nbsp; Indeed, it has absorbed the wit and energy of scholars and statesmen for centuries.&nbsp; It is a familiar subject to Americans who, since our founding, have faced emergencies that have outrun the law.&nbsp; It became a prominent issue during the Cold War, as presidents and their supporters urged unbridled executive power to confront the Soviet bogeyman.&nbsp; Since 9/11, the issue of the scope of presidential power has become the issue of the season, as presidents and their champions have urged the removal of restraints from the exercise of executive power.&nbsp; We find the arguments in the Torture Memos and in the rationales invoked by the Obama Administration.&nbsp; So, this is a theme that resounds across the centuries and represents philosophical, political, legal and constitutional questions of great moment for the republic.&nbsp; Among others, we may raise the question:&nbsp; Is it possible to suspend liberties in times of crisis in order to preserve the nation without surrendering American Constitutionalism?&nbsp; Can those liberties, once sacrificed, be restored?&nbsp; Can we save Democracy through un-Democratic means?

   <h2>Turning of the Wheel: A Humanities Exploration<br /> &quot;Invisible Spokes: The Ubiquity of Magic in the West&quot;</h2> 
   <p style=""margin-right: 0.5in;""><strong>Garth ReeseUI Library, Special Collections and Archives<br /> September 13<br /> Whitewater Room, UI Commons-&nbsp;</strong><strong>12:30 <br /> </strong><br /> Abstract: In this presentation, I will show how central “magic” and its fellow occult sciences – alchemy and astrology – were to early modern thinkers, and thus why they should be central to our examination of the early modern world. Magic was explicitly theological and even orthodox in the minds of many early modern scholars, and their magical pursuits were not exceptional for the time period. In failing to comprehend this, historians, theologians, and religious studies scholars compromise the understanding of not only early modern magic, but also early modern religion and early modern culture in general. We contemporary people like to think of ourselves as “beyond such superstition,” and yet not only are we not beyond it, much of it was not superstition. By pretending that these essential spokes are invisible or altogether absent, we risk the stability of the larger wheel and ultimately we risk losing an accurate portrait of ourselves.</p>

  <p><strong>Levan Elbakidze - Assistant Professor <br /> Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology <br /> November 9 - Idaho Commons Whitewater Room <br /> 12:30 pm <br /> </strong><br /> Abstract: Concerns pertaining to bioethics in agricultural production have been on the rise in recent years. This study uses non-hypothetical experimental auctions to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for humane animal care certified cheese and ice cream. We use 2nr price and random Nth price auctions as well as Open Ended Choice Experiments in multi-product, multi-quantity, and multi-round context. Unlike previous applications of experimental auctions this study estimates WTP for multiple quantities rather than WTP for a single unit of a given product. The results contrast participants’ bids across different auction mechanisms and different products. Differences in bidding patterns are detected between auction mechanisms as well as products. Some WTP premium price for humane animal care certified ice cream is detected. However, no WTP premium price for humane animal care certified cheese is detected. The limitations and caveats of estimation results will be discussed. </p>

Will we use their forecasts to make the right decisions? Will our beliefs affect what we see happening? The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park and River of No Return Wilderness in Central Idaho and wolves' rapid population growth have become a flash-point for disagreements amongst people passionately valuing natural systems and their resources in different ways. I was asked by the National Park Service in 1989 to forecast the impact on the Northern Yellowstone elk herd of a wolf reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park. Let's look briefly at the basis for those forecasts, the results of the reintroduction, its success and use this interesting story to address these 4 questions. </p>

  <p>What is it to be a good judge?&nbsp; Unlike most professions, in countries like the United States there is no course of study designed to prepare one for the profession of judging.&nbsp; Most judges (but not all) attend law school.&nbsp; But excellence in the practice of judging requires much more than knowledge of the law.&nbsp; How do judges learn the skills and techniques necessary for their work?&nbsp; To a great extent, they learn by example and ‘on the job’.&nbsp; Yet they also learn by taking courses through judicial institutes and colleges.&nbsp; While most judicial program teachers are judges themselves, sometimes judicial institutes go outside the profession for their teachers.&nbsp; Sometimes they go even to philosophy.&nbsp; This presentation offers a glimpse into how the discipline of philosophy factors in the education of judges.</p>

It aims at providing an alternative to our increasingly economistic way of viewing life. The quality-of-life approach points towards place, community, and, as importantly, democracy rooted in people living in real places. It is a place-based approach that recognizes a geography-of-limits, specific to places and regions worldwide.The presentation also addresses why and how we have to experiment with new institutions to develop alternatives to current development trends worldwide, to create and transform spaces and global networks of production and consumption. The author concludes by calling on scholars and others&nbsp;add new dimensions of theoretical inquiry that will provide new insights on the diverse forms taken by the process of development.

It put new universities where the people were, and opened the doors to more than just the elite of societies. Equally significant, the act established institutions that provided not only theoretical knowledge, but also the specialized training in agriculture, engineering, manufacturing and other applied fields indispensable for the rebuilding of the nation after the ravages of war.<br /> <br /> Only eight months later, Congress passed, and President Lincoln signed, legislation calling for the founding of the National Academy of Sciences, which became a guiding force in the evolution of American science and technology. Through these dual actions, access to education and the advancement of knowledge became central to our nation's success. </p>

   <strong><br /> </strong>Abstract:A perfect storm of environmental, cultural and economic conditions precipitated an unprecedented epidemic of lead poisoning in Nigeria. Due to the soaring price of gold, subsistence farmers employing their wives and children in primitive artisanal mining could triple family income. However, prevailing Sharia practices required that the ore be brought into the home to crush and grind. The ore was often more than 10% lead, resulting in mass poisoning of more than 30,000 people and the deaths of 400-500 children. 
   <p>Since 2010, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering&nbsp; have collaborated in cleanup and medical treatment, decreasing mortality rates from &gt;30% to &lt;2%. Daunting cultural, logistic, socio-economic challenges were encountered in adapting sophisticated engineering and medical protocols to remote locations with little resources or infrastructure.The cleanup involved more than 350 villagers, 80 local government personnel, and 28 international advisors, including 19 Idaho residents and 10 University of Idaho alumni and students.</p>

    <strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;In a society governed by the rule of law, rather than by the mere preferences of powerful individuals, the law must embody principles broad enough to be coherent, specific enough to be effective, and flexible enough to cope with the pressures of social and technological change.&nbsp; Early Western jurisprudence was characterized by a search for immutable truths drawn from antiquity or revealed through ecclesiastical study.&nbsp; During the late Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution, immutability yielded to utilitarianism – promoting the “greatest good for the greatest number -- as the highest object of the law.&nbsp; In the mid-nineteenth century, utilitarianism evolved, or devolved, into positivism (a view that the law, having no conceptual anchor, is nothing more than a set of enforceable commands), followed by sociological jurisprudence (which treated law primarily as a process by which social forces are expressed and accommodated), and then, in the twentieth century, by “realism” (which reprised the positivist idea that law simply expresses power and cannot be expected to constrain it).&nbsp; This synthesis of law and power proved unsatisfactory.&nbsp; The Holocaust, the emergence of murderously despotic regimes in Europe and Asia, and the devastation wreaked by a second world-wide war, all contributed a rejection of rootless law.&nbsp; The jurisprudential pendulum swung back to a search for legal principles and institutions -- exemplified by the codification of universal human rights and the creation of war crimes tribunals – that would shape and sustain a durable commitment to the rule of law.&nbsp;

    This search, which continues to the present day, has advanced along many intellectual paths, two of which will be examined here:&nbsp; (1) the articulation of general principles of ethical behavior in the learned professions, such as the practice of law, coupled with situation-specific guides to appropriate conduct; and (2) the “law and economics movement,” which seeks to develop principles to advance the oft-competing goals of efficiency and equity, and to provide methods for gauging the actual impacts of statutes, regulations, and judicial decisions in particular contexts.&nbsp; In this “Humanities Exploration” program, prominent milestones along each intellectual path will be examined, and members of the audience will be challenged to think about how&nbsp;
    <em>they</em>&nbsp;would create a set of principles that do not merely evince their own personal preferences, but rather are sufficiently coherent, specific, and flexible to identify a general concept of justice, to achieve it in specific cases, and to stand the test of time.

    <strong><br /> Abstract:</strong> This year we celebrate the 150th anniversary of Idaho becoming a territory. The year 1863, then, marks the beginning of many historical developments in our state. Yet the territory—the landscape itself—was not new in 1863. Indeed, environment and culture, people and the land, had intermingled since time immemorial to create this place many of us now call home. This talk explores some of the main factors that shaped the landscape of Idaho leading up to its territorial period and suggests what meaning past Idahoans made of nature and what that might mean for us today.

   <br /> 
   <br /> 
   <strong>Abstract:</strong> In 2005, the Rocky Mountain states (Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah and Wyoming) average annual wage per job was about $4,000 less than the U.S. average. In 2009, Idaho’s average wage per job was $10,700 less.&nbsp; Idaho’s wage gap was the result of a positive sector bias on employment growth in influential low-wage sectors and negative sector bias on employment growth and the low level of wages in the influential high-wage sectors. The economy of the Rocky Mountain region can be characterized as caught in a low-skill/low-wage equilibrium trap.

This is the first of three MRIC presentations dealing with Idaho in the territorial era.

   <br /> 
   <br /> All the while, U.S. foreign policy and modernization theory optimistically promoted new policies and discourses of global trade and modern identity.&nbsp; Far from a simple icon of American patriotism, John Wayne was one of the most globally-visible models of modern manhood and subjectivity within Hollywood’s international projection of modernity and capitalism.&nbsp; Examining a range of issues still relevant to global media today, from cultural globalization, to runaway production, to the role that Hollywood plays in international constructions of gender, this presentation explores the international history of a star who has been stubbornly defined only in the context of U.S. national culture.

        <strong>Abstract</strong>: Our speakers were children and grandchildren of itinerant tent evangelists who traveled the Western United States preaching the gospel and founding some 20 churches from Arizona to California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana. Their congregations met and worked together from the 1920s to several surviving today. The evangelists and many of their congregants chose to wear their faith on their automobiles. From 1917 to the present, they artfully painted Bible verses on their cars and trailers in a specially-designed old-English font readable at highway speeds. Church leaders never solicited money, were unsalaried, and “lived by faith.” The Reese brother and sister will share what it was like growing up with 
        <em>The People of the Godmobiles,</em> title of their book project and potential Web and museum exhibits.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;The Japanese Fukushima Dai-ichi and Dai-ni nuclear power station with four&nbsp; General Electric Boiling Water Reactors respectively co-located side-by-side on the north-central eastern coast of Japan withstood a 9.0 earthquake and a large-scale tsunami on March 11, 2011.&nbsp; All six units were constructed via a GE/Hitachi/Toshiba collaboration from 1967 to 1979. In spite of the immediate shut down of all units due to the earthquake, and decay heat cooling for 30-45 minutes, loss-of-offsite-power by the impact of the tsunami initiated an “beyond design basis (nuclear power plant) accident.” Several hydrogen explosions later, several core “meltdowns” and 1&frac12;&nbsp; years since 3/11, the utility (TEPCO) and the Japanese Government are still dealing with a dramatic shift in the national energy portfolio and ‘recovery, restoration and remediation’ that may last up to 40 years. The colloquium will provide a quick perspective on the Fukushima natural disaster, the nuclear power plant accident and the potential global implications in coming years.

        <em>useful fictions</em> important to their fields and that awaking students to this concept helped cultivate their understanding and engagement.&nbsp; In our presentation, they will explore, among other things, what Leibniz’s infinitesimal calculus and Cervantes’&nbsp;
        <em>Don Quixote</em>, both works of the early modern period, have in common.

We will have more large fires and smoke in the future. Why? Because we live in a fire environment.&nbsp; In most of the world, biomass accumulates faster than it decomposes, and the excess biomass can fuel fires that ignite under hot, dry, windy conditions. Fire management is challenging, for many fire effects are good, and others are bad. How can fire science help us? What can you do to protect your home and encourage sound fire management? How do we educate leaders and work with leaders in wildland fire here at the University of Idaho, where we have been national leaders for more than 35 years? Come join the conversation!</p>

  <strong><br /> <br /> Abstract&nbsp;<br /> </strong>The Affordable Care Act was signed into law on March 23, 2010 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 23, 2012. &nbsp;It is now the law of the land. Now, our challenge as scholars, professionals, businesses, and community leaders is to design our shared future instead of trying to repeal or un-fund ACA. &nbsp;Three focus areas of the national dialogue over health care are: protecting the individual, enhancing wellness and prevention, and caring for communities. Change creates many opportunities to make things better through innovations, collaborations and translations. This presentation offers a long view of the factors affecting our quality of life and strategies for how to get there.

She builds on previous studies in the area of gender and politics that study the possible impact of a federal ministry for women’s affairs (WPA) in selected European countries on a variety of policy issues. In her study, she expands on the underlying theories to include an examination of “discursive opportunity structures” as a variable that explains family policy change across countries. For this purpose, she selected two political events that offered discursive opportunity: German reunification (1990) and the European Union’s Amsterdam Treaty (1997) to explain the role of the WPA in family policy change in contemporary Germany. <br /> <br /> <strong>Biography</strong> <br /> Sandra Reineke earned her BA at Freie Universit&auml;t in Berlin and her Ph.D. from Indiana University, both in political science. Her research and teaching interests are in the fields of political philosophy, international relations, and comparative politics, focusing on feminist political theory, citizenship and democratic theory, and gender, primarily in Western Europe and North America. Her book, entitled Beauvoir and Her Sisters. The Politics of Women's Bodies in France, was published in 2011 by the University of Illinois Press. Dr. Reineke has also published scholarly articles in the area of bioethics and biomedical policy making as well as on the French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir.

  <strong><br /> <br /> Abstract&nbsp;<br /> </strong>Recognizing that understanding and change often start with younger generations, we will teach students in kindergarten through college about the relationship between agriculture and climate change. The education team of the Regional Approaches to Climate Change in Pacific Northwest Agriculture (REACCH-PNA) project is developing curriculum for K-12 students and designing workshops for teachers to bring agriculture and climate change into public schools. The team conducted a survey of elementary and secondary teachers to assess levels of knowledge about climate change and agriculture, willingness to integrate and their curriculum needs. The team used the results of this survey to define activities. The team’s ultimate goal is to produce citizens and professionals equipped to address the challenges that climate change could pose for agriculture and agriculture’s role in providing food, energy and ecosystems.

  <strong><br /> <br /> Abstract</strong> 
  <br /> Is the National Rifle Association correct in its assertion that violence in our society is attributable to our entertainment media? Is it possible that music can be a co-conspirator in subliminal messaging of Hollywood films? 
  <br /> 
  <br /> Certain emotions, characters, and ethics have been linked, possibly intentionally, with specific elements of film music. While the use of bird calls and other simulated sounds of nature have been common but superficial vocabulary in “art” music for centuries, similar techniques used in the music of a Hollywood film frequently tell the audience how to respond to the images seen on the screen. In some demonstrable cases, the musical narrative has been moralistic, and the results of these efforts have been quite effective. This audio-visual presentation is designed to demonstrate some tricks of the trade, and to invite discussion among members of the audience about memorable moments in film music.

          <br /> 
          <strong>Abstract</strong> 
          <br /> About three years ago, the Department of Chemistry started a collaboration with Mark Warner (Sociology/Anthropology) on the chemical analysis of archaeological artifacts recovered from various locations in the Pacific Northwest. We deal with historic, rather than prehistoric, materials, and most items analyzed in the laboratory are bottles and containers with mysterious contents. The work is mostly carried out by undergraduate researchers, who sign up for it via an Undergraduate Research (Chem 491) course. The course primarily involves analytical chemistry, but archival and ethnographic investigations also play an important role. The work has turned out to be highly motivating to undergraduates, who find this kind of chemical detective work intriguing. It also has definite didactic value, since it exposes students to techniques and insights that they would never come across in a standard “recipe-based” laboratory. Sometimes there are Eureka moments, while at other times the conclusion is “that’s just dirt.”

This presentation will describe current research on that question as well as the empirical methods involved in answering it. It will be the point of departure to discuss determination of cause and effect in non-experimental contexts. The presentation will discuss statistical issues with the use of proxy and instrumental variables, as well as panel data.

His doctoral dissertation research studied the importance of Ph.D. students to the conduct of science at U.S. universities and how changes to visa and immigration policies for foreign graduate students may affect scientific research. This research received funding from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and the National Science Foundation. An analysis of the effects of immigration policy on science and innovation by Stuen and his co-authors was recently published in Science. His work was short-listed for a “best paper” award from Britain’s Royal Economic Society and has been discussed in the New York Times and Science Careers, among other media outlets.

  <p><strong>Tuesday, February 11, 2014 | 12:30-1:30 p.m.&nbsp; <br /> Whitewater Room, Idaho Commons<br /> </strong><strong><br /> Presenters:<br /> Kate Cleary - Ph.D. candidate, CATIE (Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center) and the University of Idaho <br /> <br /> Lisette Waits - Professor, Department of Fish and Wildlife, University of Idaho<br /> <br /> <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/hejQ2Gh_6BE""></iframe> <br /> <br /> Abstract <br /> </strong>Tropical forests cover less than 23 percent of the earth’s surface, but contain over 50 percent of its biodiversity, providing essential ecosystem services to the entire globe. Unfortunately, these amazing forests are becoming increasingly scarce as human population growth drives the conversion of tropical forests to agriculture and urban development. An interdisciplinary team of students and faculty is addressing this challenge with our joint research project in the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor (SJLS) in Costa Rica. The team is composed of forest ecologists, wildlife biologists, conservation geneticists and sociologists, all working to answer a small piece of the complex question of whether the SJLS is “working” for both human communities and populations of native plants and animals. This presentation will describe the organization of our team through the UI’s IGERT program, explain linked research designs, and report some of our most interesting results to date. The presenters will also share exciting photos of tropical wildlife and stories about conducting field research in the tropics. <br /> <br /> <strong>Biographies <br /> <br /> Kate Cleary</strong> is a Ph.D. candidate in the joint doctoral program between CATIE (Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center) and the University of Idaho. Her current research uses a landscape genetics approach to assess the effects of land use change on functional connectivity for frugivorous bats. In 2013, Kate received a Fulbright Scholarship to complete a portion of her Ph.D. in Costa Rica. Before beginning her Ph.D., Kate earned a MSc. in Fish and Wildlife Biology through the Peace Corps Masters International program at Colorado State University. Through this program, she served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala, where she worked as a biologist and environmental educator in a national park and collected data on the bird community. Kate's hope for all her research projects is that they will contribute to finding a balance between conservation and development in rural landscapes. <br /> <br /> <strong>Lisette Waits</strong> grew up in rural Georgia with dreams of one day becoming a scientist and studying wild animals. After obtaining a doctorate at the University of Utah studying the genetic diversity and evolution of grizzly bears, she traveled to the Universite Joseph Fourier in France to study the conservation genetics of brown bears in France and Scandinavia. Since joining the faculty at the University of Idaho in 1997, Lisette has focused on the conservation genetics, molecular ecology and landscape genetics of wild populations with particular focus on endangered carnivores. Lisette is a co-founder of the Laboratory for Ecological, Evolutionary and Conservation Genetics and the Center for Research on Invasive Species and Small Populations. She has been a member of a number of interdisciplinary research teams including two NSF-IGERT projects. Lisette’s current research projects use molecular genetic techniques to study a variety of threatened or vulnerable species in Europe, Asia, North and South America.</p>

Media coverage of events that are framed as terrorism likely creates a unique emotional trajectory. A survey was distributed asking individuals for their recollection of their emotional and behavioral responses at three points in time marked by media headlines. The results explore the ways in which affective and behavioral responses upon encountering news of the bombing, impacted emotional responses when the suspects were identified, and then again when authorities took the life of one suspect and detained and charged the other. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Biography<br /> </strong>Traci Craig graduated from Purdue University in 2002 with a Ph.D. in social psychology and joined the University of Idaho faculty in the same year. She is currently serving as chair of the Department of Psychology and Communication Studies as well as an Administrative Fellow for the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences. Her research interests focus on issues of language and decision-making, gender and diversity, and group dynamics. Today’s presentation reflects some of her newer work, undertaken with Dr. Annette Folwell in Communication Studies, examining the timeline of affect following terrorist acts.</p>

  <p><strong><strong> Abstract&nbsp;<br /> </strong>Is it possible that art inspired by science is redefining art, as well as the concept of aesthetics, too? The popularization of science-inspired art in recent years suggests this is so. As disciplines, art and science are amazingly similar in how individuals seek to know about our world and contribute in some way to the understanding of it. Sayler will briefly discuss her artwork within this milieu, in which the locus of magic for her dwells somewhere between the physical and metaphysical. She will also provide a glimpse of the ways modern science is shaping the expression of other contemporary artists, who are driven by its beauty, complexity and mystery. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Biographies</strong> <br /> During the past six years, Gerri Sayler has created site-specific installations for museums and galleries using fibers as sculptural media. Inspired by the region’s landscapes and natural history, her work draws on textures, line and repetition to explore cycles of nature and the nature of time. Her solo exhibit history includes Suyama Space/Seattle, Boise Art Museum, Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture, University of Wyoming Art Museum and Missoula Art Museum. She has been commissioned to create a large-scale installation in January inspired by the cataclysmic history of the Yellowstone Caldera. The artist graduated from the University of Idaho in 2007 with a B.F.A in Studio Art summa cum laude; she also holds a B.S. in Journalism from the University of North Dakota.</strong></p>

  <h2>“Fire as a Teacher: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Wildfire”</h2> 
  <p><strong>Tuesday, February 4, 2014 | 12:30-1:30 p.m.&nbsp; <br /> Whitewater Room, Idaho Commons<br /> </strong><strong><br /> Presenter:<br /> Crystal Kolden - Assistant Professor, Department of Geography<br /> <br /> <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/KTcofKuVL6s""></iframe><br /> Abstract <br /> </strong>Wildfire is often described as a catastrophe, a disaster, a disturbance, and other menacing and negative terms. In reality, wildfire is a natural occurrence that is central to the functional ecologies of most global ecosystems, and it is our human perspectives and inabilities to deal with wildfire and its impacts that are the disaster. While there are numerous suggestions from the media, politicians, and citizens for how to deal with the wildfire “problem,” science offers a clearer picture of the path forward. Utilization of the best available climate and science information, as well as learning from past fire events, can help communities redefine their relationship with wildfire and begin to embrace it across fire-prone landscapes. <br /> <br /> <strong>Biography <br /> </strong>Crystal Kolden earned a bachelor’s degree in history from Cornell University, a master’s in geography from the University of Nevada and a Ph.D. in geography from Clark University. Her background includes over a decade of employment with the U.S. Forest Service (including time as a wildland firefighter) and the U.S. Geological Survey. Her research focuses on science applications and technology transfer for public policy makers and land use managers, working primarily in the western United States and Alaska. She is interested in large-scale abiotic and disturbance factors such as wildfire, invasive species, and climate change. Dr. Kolden joined the University of Idaho Geography Department in 2010.</p>

An “impact network analysis” (INA) can be implemented to evaluate the integrated effects of research results and new technologies, communication networks, decision networks, and ecological/transport networks. For example, an INA can be used to evaluate the likely outcomes of different strategies for management of a disease or pest under climate change. The driving factors of epidemic networks may vary widely from one system to another, whether movement is by human transport, vectors, wind, rain, or other means. However, if the general structure of an epidemic network is known, it can be used to identify key locations for sampling and mitigation, as well as being incorporated in a broader INA. Examples of the application of an INA to stored grain networks and smallholder farm seed systems will be discussed. <br /> <br /> <strong>Biography<br /> </strong>Karen Garrett is a Professor in the Department of Plant Pathology at Kansas State University.

          <strong>Abstract</strong> 
          <br /> Law can be thought of as both a profession and a discipline and can function as either in an interdisciplinary research project. The key for interdisciplinary collaboration is to know which to apply. In the academic setting, law is more frequently approached from the professional viewpoint in outreach or service, and from the viewpoint of a discipline in interdisciplinary research. The current review of the Columbia River Treaty and the involvement of the Universities Consortium on Columbia River Governance in engaging and informing basin stakeholders illustrates the role of law in outreach in what is nevertheless, a highly interdisciplinary project. The same treaty review process is part of a case study for an interdisciplinary research project on adaptive governance. The resilience and law project, supported by the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under funding from the National Science Foundation DBI-1052875, is bringing together an interdisciplinary team of legal scholars, ecologists and climate scientists to explore governance of major North American water basins in the face of uncertainty and changing climate. This project illustrates the role of law as a discipline in an interdisciplinary project.

  <strong>Abstract</strong> 
  <br /> Portland-born John Reed is an icon of American radicalism. He was witness to the Bolshevik Revolution, and his Ten Days That Shook the World remains an important account. He became a founder of the U.S. Communist Party, died in Moscow, Russia, and was honored by the Soviets with a grave along the Kremlin Wall. 
  <br /> 
  <br /> But was Reed really what he seemed? Was he, in, fact a long-time agent of American agencies and interests? Did some of his Soviet comrades discover or suspect this and did that lead to his premature death? 
  <br /> 
  <br /> The answers may lie in the curious relationship between Reed and Weston Estes, a U.S. Army intelligence officer who infiltrated the radical movement of which Reed was a part. In 1920, Estes helped free Reed from a jail in Finland, and Reed then assisted Estes in entering Soviet Russia on a secret mission, a mission that may have sealed the fate of both men.

          <strong>Abstract</strong> 
          <br /> Why do terms for disability keep changing? According to the “euphemism treadmill” theory, cyclic replacement happens reactively, as negative connotations accrue to each new “euphemism.” Analyzing corpus data within a Cognitive Linguistics framework, the present study significantly revises this model. New terms originate proactively, in attempts to “reframe” disability. The ‘{X}-impaired’ construction frames it as quantifiable deviation from clinically established norms, objectifying the disabled as clients of a clinical establishment (cf. Foucault’s Birth of the Clinic). Promoting a newer ‘social’ model of disability, the 1970s Disabilities Rights Movement pioneered the ‘{X}-challenged’ construction. It invokes a rhetoric of “challenge” drawn from progressive educational theory (especially Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed), reframing disability as a struggle for personal and social self-actualization. While parodying the euphemism treadmill, subsequent humorous ‘PC’ extensions (…“vertically challenged” [=short], “navigationally impaired” [=bad driver]…) also playfully reflect and critique ‘identity politics’ and its role in contemporary American society.

He has taught English and Modern Languages (mostly German) at the UI since 1993. His research focuses on how words acquire new meanings through inferential reasoning by hearers in specific conversational contexts. Publications also include analyses of Greek inter- and intratextuality in the gospel of Mark, and (with Ellen Kittell) of gender inclusivity in medieval northern French town ordinances.

In 2011 she joined the English Department at Paris Ouest—Nanterre La D&eacute;fense as an assistant professor. She has geared her research around the interplay between form, meaning and function in grammatical constructions. Given her interest in the tension between conservatism and creativity in language, she also explores how constructions develop and change over time. The languages she studies – often from a contrastive perspective – are primarily English and French.

Yet when one considers the statistics regarding the greatest number of deaths over a given time period, the 1918 influenza epidemic, or Spanish flu, ranks No. 1. Mortality rate estimates range from 20 million to more than 100 million deaths during the year it circumscribed the globe. Coming at the end of World War I, it killed more individuals than the war itself (estimated at 9.2 combat deaths and 15 million total deaths). More than 25 percent of the U.S. population was infected during this year. This presentation will review the history of the 1918 epidemic and its influence on public health policy. Additionally, our present-day understanding of flu epidemiology and forensic methods to recover the 1918 virus provide a contextual basis for present concerns regarding Avian flu and emerging virus strains. <br /> <br /> Biography<br /> Scott Minnich is a professor of microbiology at the University of Idaho.

However, on-the-ground AD realization has been impeded by process stability/reliability concerns and poor economics. Considering these challenges but recognizing that AD represents a fundamentally sound manure management approach, an interdisciplinary research team has investigated an integrated process that will improve manure management economics and reduce dairy GHG emissions. This talk focuses on a critical element within this process: synthesizing bioplastics on fermented manure. Drs. Coats and McDonald have collaborated to advance fundamental operating criteria for the process, and are currently conducting investigations in an effort to ultimately commercialize this technology.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Biographies<br /> Erik R.

          <strong><br /> <br /> Abstract</strong> 
          <br /> The skyrocketing cost of scholarly journals is one of the most difficult and pressing problems faced by academic librarians today. At the same time, researchers have the obligation and desire to publish their findings in reputable scholarly journals but often face long lag-times for publication and hefty page charges. 
          <br /> 
          <br /> Modern technologies offer a potential solution. One approach being pursued by many scholars and librarians is that of open access publishing. Open access publishing, the practice of making scholarly research freely available to the public without barriers, is a publishing practice recently adopted by the Rangeland Center when it decided to create its own journal, the Journal of Rangeland Applications. 
          <br /> 
          <br /> Representatives from both the Library and the Rangeland Center will describe the process of creating the journal on the Open Journal Systems platform while maintaining a rigorous peer-review process, and discuss the importance of making scholarly research and educational materials freely available to the public. This project reflects a powerful collaboration between librarians and researchers to overcome modern publishing challenges and make information widely available to those who need it.

  <br /> Nuclear physics has many applications. Unfortunately, the more controversial ones, like nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, are the best known and to some people the only known ones. However, there are hundreds of nuclear physics applications that are a blessing to mankind. In particular, uses of nuclear physics in medicine save and improve thousands of lives every day. The treatment of cancer by proton and heavy-ion beam radiation is one of the greatest success stories that, regrettably, your family doctor and even your medical “specialist” probably never heard of. Therefore, I will tell this story in this colloquium.

In practice, projects engaged in what might be termed “big interdisciplinarity” necessarily include simultaneous multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary and participatory activities, which together constitute a project’s dynamic “architecture of adaptive integration” (AAI). Regional Approaches to Climate Change (REACCH) is a large ($20M) USDA-funded, multi-institutional project addressing sustainability of wheat production systems under current and projected climates for the inland Pacific Northwest. The talk by REACCH director Sanford Eigenbrode will review the genesis, goals and activities of REACCH, the challenges and successes of the collaboration, and how its AAI is evolving as the project matures. </p>

  <br /> 
  <strong>Abstract&nbsp;<br /> </strong>This session will discuss the fallacy that rule-based ethics can mythically solve ethical violations of rules within the NCAA. The current rule deontic philosophy utilized by the NCAA and other organizations generally leads to ethical dilemmas being resolved in court or protracted legal maneuvering, i.e., Lance Armstrong and USADA. When this occurs, ethics become legalized and are classified in yes or no terms. However, ethics can be useful and practical when all collateral fibers of an issue are considered. Unfortunately, as now formulated, the NCAA may never reform itself nor use a different basis of reasoning. The NCAA is unwieldy in its administrative structure and its ethical position is questionable considering its argument that athletes in revenue producing sport are amateurs. We will discuss some present solutions offered by experts in the fields whereby ethics could actually be practiced.

Federalism has changed in theory because we have changed the U.S. Constitution and our understanding of it in profound ways. Federalism has evolved in practice because we think about governing differently; good government does not mean the same thing today that it meant in 1789. The interesting question, however, is whether changes in theory lead to changes in practice or changes in practice lead to changes in theory. The purpose of this paper is to examine this question through the lens of punctuated equilibrium theory. The paper offers refinements to Baumgartner and Jones’s ideas about federalism as a system of policy venues (2009), and attempts a theoretical contribution by looking specifically at the relationship between equity and policy change in the context of an evolving federalism. <br /> <br /> <strong>Biography</strong> <br /> Brian A.

  <strong>Abstract</strong> 
  <br /> Throughout history and in many cultures, musicians have used vibrato as an expressive device. Psychologist Carl Seashore wrote, “A good vibrato is a pulsation of pitch, usually accompanied with synchronous pulsations of loudness and timbre, of such extent and rate as to give a pleasing flexibility, tenderness, and richness to the tone.” A vibrato is a marker of one’s personal style, but there are boundaries of good taste, parodied by Burt Lahr as the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz. A vibrato can be too fast, too slow, too wide, too shallow, too irregular, or too mechanical. What are these boundaries? Technology provides tools to measure a vibrato’s speed and extent and to analyze how excellent musicians employ it.
  <br /> 
  <br /> 
  <strong>Biography</strong>
  <br /> 
  <strong>Leonard Garrison</strong> shares years of research analyzing thousands of recordings of musicians using vibrato. He has previously presented this topic at the National Flute Association and the British Flute Society. In 2006, Garrison joined the faculty of the Lionel Hampton School of Music, where he teaches flute and aural skills. He is flutist in the Northwest Wind Quintet, the Scott/Garrison Duo, and the IWO Flute Quartet, and principal flutist of the Walla Walla Symphony. He holds a Doctor of Music degree from Northwestern University. Garrison received Master of Music and Master of Arts degrees from The State University of New York at Stony Brook and his Bachelor of Music from the Oberlin Conservatory of Music.

  <strong><br /> <br /> Abstract</strong>
  <br /> The Civilian Conservation Corps was the first, most far-reaching, longest-lived and best-loved of the New Deal programs in a decade full of big ideas and supersized projects. The CCC remains an outstanding example of how the United States acted in time of national crisis to mitigate the catastrophic effects of economic collapse for ordinary people while producing a legacy of public benefit for all. This presentation, however, reconsiders the CCC in fresh perspective and places Idaho—specifically the CCC in Idaho forests—at the very heart of contemporary issues regarding conservation, fire ecology and resource management. Essential to the research of this project is the digitizing of thousands of photographs and documents by the University of Idaho Library Digital Initiatives, and the process of making those available to the public and scholars.

  <p> </p> 
  <p style=""margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"">For centuries, Burmese Buddhists lived in relative harmony with the Muslims among them. All of this changed during British colonial times, when Indian administrators replaced an efficient Burmese civil service and thousands of Indian laborers were brought in to work in the rice fields and on the docks. Christian missionaries also introduced the idea of a pure religion, and a Buddhist fundamentalism arose. The Venerable Ashin Wirathu, abbot of one of Burma’s largest monasteries, has been preaching incendiary sermons against the Burma’s Muslim minority. Wirathu is calling for a boycott of Muslim businesses and a ban on interfaith marriages to preserve “racial purity.” Wirathu has inspired armed Buddhists to kill Muslims and burn their businesses and mosques. <strong></strong></p>

In the case of global warming, current opinions are probably shifting too slowly for there to be any real deceleration of climate change, in spite of mounting evidence and the efforts of many eloquent people. One possible explanation for this is a tension between local and global exchanges of opinion. To investigate this possibility, Prof. Baumgaertner developed a model to help us understand how various factors at the individual level contribute to opinion dynamics at the population level, particularly with respect to local interactions. This research also focuses on the time scale on which our simulated populations shift their opinion. This is important for understanding whether the world population can change enough of its opinions in a short amount of time to avert catastrophic effects of climate change.<br /> <strong><br /> Biography<br /> </strong>Bert Baumgaertner is an assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences.

  <strong><br /> <br /> Abstract</strong>
  <br /> Four-term Sen. Frank Church was one of the leading figures in Idaho’s first century and would make any short list of the most important U.S. senators of the past 50 years. From advocating for wilderness areas to opposing the Vietnam War to investigating the CIA, Church was a leader on a host of difficult issues – and he did so representing a state where his views were not always in the majority. In his political career and personal life, he fought the odds until his untimely death in 1984. This presentation, by one of the authors of the authoritative biography of Church, will look back at Church’s life and legacy 30 years after his death.

Studies of ecological morphology (the relationship between an organism’s form, function, and environment) bridge multiple disciplines, including biomechanics, ecology, phylogenetics, and comparative methods. As part of his doctoral degree, Travis Hagey gathered data and tested hypotheses considering links between morphology, performance, and ecology, focusing on the adhesive abilities of geckos. Geckos are an understudied, diverse group of lizards, well known for their adhesive toe pads. Hagey proposes that geckos are an excellent interdisciplinary study system due to the breadth of morphological, performance, and ecological variation across species, the presence of many recent phylogenetic hypotheses detailing evolutionary relationships among gecko species, and the fascinating characteristics inherent in the gecko adhesive system.<strong><br /> <br /> Biography<br /> </strong>Growing up camping, helping his father rebuild classic cars and playing with Legos, Travis Hagey acquired an interest in biology and engineering early in life. Prior to high school, He was convinced he wanted to be a paleontologist. In college, his interests transitioned to evolutionary biology, leading him to complete B.S. in cellular biology from Western Washington University. As an undergraduate, Hagey completed a lizard ecology field course taught by Dr. Roger Anderson. This course set him on a herpetological research trajectory that led to his Ph.D. adviser at the University of Idaho, Dr. Luke Harmon. During graduate school, the novel adhesive system of geckos became Travis’s main research topic, incorporating biomechanics, evolution, and ecology. To fund his postdoctoral research, Travis collaborated with Dr. Matt Riley in the UI’s Mechanical Engineering department, receiving funding from the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action. <strong><br /> <br /> </strong></p>

  <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> 
  <p>The University of Idaho, Idaho’s oldest university and “Flagship University” is celebrating its 125<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2014. The UI has nearly 100,000 alumni, contributes nearly $1 billion to Idaho’s economy and attracts approximately $100 million in total research dollars per year. Yet the UI is in a “helicopter growth pattern” from nearly a decade-long period of very slow growth (if not actual decline) in student enrollments, total research dollars, and state funding. The UI faces special challenges because of its rural and isolated location, residential campus environment, land grant status and historic legacy programs. The UI’s growth challenges may affect its long-term mission in Idaho. It also has implications for the economic and population growth for Moscow and the regional economy.</p>

  <p style=""line-height: 115%;"">To meet future energy needs without polluting the environment by ejecting carbon dioxide, nuclear energy is one of the best sources of clean energy. Any process for disposal of used nuclear fuel needs to have minimal impact on the environment. &nbsp;Plutonium and uranium recovery is performed using the PUREX process. However, this comes with certain disadvantages such as the requirement for large quantities of separation reagents and the generation of significant volumes of secondary waste that might increase the threat of proliferation. Magnetic Separation Nanotechnology developed at UI will provide an effective method for used nuclear fuel recycling, as it is a simple, versatile, compact and cost-efficient process that minimizes secondary waste and improves storage performance.</p>

  <strong>Abstract</strong>
  <br /> Studies show that young Americans are interested in news but are unlikely to seek it out from traditional (legacy) media such as newspapers or television. In the digital age, students get their news through social media, non-legacy blogs and Internet content providers – and the Daily Show. But much of the material that passes through the digital pipeline is fact-less punditry, false assertion or outright fabrication. News literacy education is designed to help students navigate the digital universe, sorting the true from the false and finding information needed for the exercise of citizenship. Prof. Smith includes a news literacy unit in his Media and Society course, based on a curriculum developed by the News Literacy Institute at Stony Brook University. He advocates a news literacy requirement for all UI students.

  <h2>&quot;Promoting Writing and Critical Thinking in Undergraduate Classrooms&quot;</h2> 
  <p><strong>Wednesday, October 8, 2014 | 12:30-1:30 p.m.&nbsp; <br /> Crest-Horizons, Idaho Commons<br /> <br /> Presenter:&nbsp;<br /> John Bean - Seattle University, visiting scholar, Department of English</strong></p>

  <strong><br /> <br /> Abstract</strong>
  <br /> Learning to write in a major field means learning to “think like a professional” in that discipline. Drawing on assignment examples from across the curriculum, this presentation will try to show how short writing assignments focused on authentic disciplinary problems can accelerate students’ growth from novice to expert within a disciplinary field. Using the principle of backward design of the curriculum—often facilitated by faculty-owned assessment—faculty can create assignments that gradually increase in complexity and difficulty. By scaffolding assignments within a course or curriculum, faculty can help novices learn to do undergraduate research-- to pose disciplinary questions, conduct inquiry, write literature reviews that position their work within a conversation, and produce their own idea-rich arguments. 
  <br />

  <p><strong><br /> Abstract</strong></p> 
  <p>Historic mining towns in the Intermountain West persist along a spectrum that includes virtual ghost towns, towns that have been preserved by deliberate policy or neglect, and towns that are being transformed by unbridled contemporary development. Why did some towns persevere during the mining era and others fail? During the post-mining era, why have some communities been more successful at preserving their historic contexts and adapting them to fit the needs of contemporary economies and culture? What lessons might be learned to help guide sustainable development in small towns?&nbsp; The presentation and discussion will use representative mining communities throughout the Rocky Mountain West to help address these questions. </p>

  <strong>Abstract</strong>
  <br /> Before it is heard in a concert hall, a handmade classical guitar is raw wood in a forest. A builder chooses his woods from a seller of tone woods and when a player orders a guitar, a series of decisions are made regarding the selection of woods and many other variables before a concert instrument is produced. This presentation will reveal the decisions made by a performer ordering a hand-made guitar and the relationship that develops between builder and performer. The presentation will conclude with a short performance.

  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br /> Eugenics, a philosophical position positing that humans, like wheat on the Palouse, could be engineered through “better” breeding, was taught at the University of Idaho (as well as many other land-grant universities) through at least the 1940s (Glenna, Gollnick, and Jones, 2007)*. This position allowed for the forced sterilization of people deemed “undesirable” and was widely popular until Hitler’s use of eugenics was shown in horrific detail. Using this idea of as a starting point, this talk considers how knowledge is produced and the responsibilities of people to be aware of their particular social position and epistemology. Encouraging learners to dwell in contradictions and be open to others’ worldview, this talk explores the importance of a liberal arts education in creating an educated populace for a healthy democracy. <br /> <br /> <strong>Biography</strong><br /> Ryanne Pilgeram is an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology and director of the Certificate in Diversity and Stratification at the University of Idaho.

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>Interdisciplinary efforts are critical to address the complex problems our society faces. This talk will highlight a model for educating doctoral students for careers involving interdisciplinary, team-based research created as part of two National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Research and Education Traineeship (NSF-IGERT) projects. The educational model was developed by faculty at the University of Idaho and the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center (CATIE) in Costa Rica. The model involves: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Identification of integrated research questions combining team members’ disciplines;</li> 
   <li>Coursework to review theoretical underpinnings of interdisciplinarity and develop integrated research proposals to address research questions;</li> 
   <li>Meetings and workshops to enhance team cohesiveness;</li> 
   <li>Engagement with stakeholders;</li> 
   <li>Interdisciplinary team research that yields joint dissertation chapters and publications.&nbsp;</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The model achieved a level of integration unique among graduate education programs. More than 40 doctoral students have participated over the past 15 years. Using examples from IGERT projects, the talk will emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary team research and training for graduate students.</p> 
  <h4>Biography</h4>

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>Within the last ten years, frontier forests of Central America have become a strategic distribution center for drug traffickers transporting cocaine from South America into the United States. While drug trafficking is known to have deleterious societal effects, the relationship between drug trafficking and deforestation in Central America is not well understood.</p> 
  <p>This research investigates the connection between drug trafficking and deforestation in the Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve (RPBR) of Honduras. Remote sensing analyses of Landsat and SPOT images show that deforestation rates have accelerated and the size of deforestation patches have increased in the RPBR in the last ten &nbsp;years.</p> 
  <p>Results from secondary data, key informant interviews and community surveys conducted, indicate that the direct and indirect effects of drug money laundering through cattle ranching are a major driver of tropical deforestation. Under these circumstances, market-based payments from REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) for forest conservation are neither politically tenable nor economically powerful enough to stop forest conversion.</p> 
  <p>These results reveal new proximate and underlying drivers of deforestation in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. Recommendations for REDD+ include project designs that support local governance and provide development opportunities to stem land-use change driven by lucrative, albeit illegal activities.</p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>Color vision in vertebrates requires the existence of multiple types of cone photoreceptors in the retina, each of which has a different sensitivity to the visual spectrum. Spectral sensitivities are conferred by the visual pigment present within cone photoreceptors. In primates and in fishes, the diversity of cone photoreceptor types has been increased through evolutionarily recent duplications of visual pigment genes.</p> 
  <p>In humans, the tandemly duplicated “red pigment” and “green pigment” genes on the X chromosome underlie trichromatic color vision. Defects in these genes result in color blindness and X-linked retinal degenerations. Treatments for some of these disorders would be facilitated by further knowledge of how differential gene expression — the production of a red pigment vs. a green pigment — is regulated in developing cone photoreceptors.</p> 
  <p>Our research group has recently uncovered evidence that the expression of pigments from a similar tandemly replicated red pigment gene array in zebrafish can be regulated by the developmental signaling molecules, retinoic acid, and thyroid hormone. Our findings suggest that tandemly duplicated cone pigment genes may be amenable to therapeutic manipulation.</p>

  <p>Deborah Stenkamp is a professor of Biological Sciences and the current College of Science Malcolm and Carol Renfrew faculty fellow. She has maintained an NIH-supported research program in development and regeneration of the visual system, at the University of Idaho, since 1997.

  <h4><strong>Abstract</strong></h4> 
  <p>What happens behind the scenes in an opera star's life? This presentation will demonstrate how genealogical and court documents from Viennese church and state archives provide a realistic view of how two prominent court opera singers, Irene Tomeoni (ca. 1763-1830) and Theresia Saal (1782-1855), negotiated their professional and personal lives. The results are not quite what one would expect — equal pay for equal work, paid maternity leave, retirement planning through real estate investment — leading us to challenge assumptions that women had no financial or legal power in patriarchal 19th-century Vienna. </p>

  <h4><strong>Abstract</strong></h4> 
  <p>While the Classroom Strategic Planning Workgroup was noticing an increased demand for both classroom technology and flexible spaces with moveable furniture, the Doceo Center for Innovation + Learning was experiencing a demand for its lab space by faculty seeking to innovate their active learning style courses. A collaborative effort between the two groups was born to attempt to make these spaces a reality on campus. The new College of Education building will fulfill a need for both types of spaces when it reopens in the fall of 2016. This presentation will describe the formation of an Active Learning Discussion Circle and how the planning of these spaces evolved.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>John Mullan&rsquo;s celebrated road, a 625-mile link that connected the Missouri and Columbia rivers and eventually became a significant component of Interstate 90, established the West Point graduate as an accomplished engineer. Although the road&rsquo;s significance in settling the Northwest is mentioned in nearly every book about the region, Mullan himself has remained an enigma: A dashing young Army officer who came west and built an important highway, but then disappears from the written record. But Mullan lived to see automobiles traveling his former wagon road. Petersen traveled to repositories from coast to coast in his search for the real John Mullan. This new biography reveals a complex personality who skirted legal and ethical boundaries to gain fame and wealth.</p>

  <h4><strong>Abstract</strong></h4> 
  <p>Next year will mark 80 years since the outbreak in 1936 of Spain’s Civil War. This brutal war lasted for nearly three years (July 1936-March 1939), claiming at least one-half million lives and sending another one-half million refugees into exile. For Ernest Hemingway, the fight against General Francisco Franco became a cause of utmost importance. In March 1937, he traveled to Madrid to observe conditions firsthand. Reporting on the war for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA), Hemingway penned 31 dispatches from Spain. He also helped to produce a pro-Republican film, &quot;The Spanish Earth.&quot; His experiences during the civil war provided the material for what many consider to be Hemingway’s most famous novel, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1940). This presentation touches on debates related to Hemingway’s presence in Spain and his actions on behalf of the Republic.</p>

  <h4><strong>Abstract</strong></h4> 
  <p>Graduate students at the University of Idaho, with faculty advisors, surveyed stakeholders in Idaho to assess perceived impacts of climate change to natural resources across the state. This survey led to a set of long-term physical and biological observations that compose climate indicators for the state of Idaho. From the timing of lilac blooms and mountain bluebird nest records to the amount of snowpack and streamflow, these climate indicators provide a comprehensive picture of climate variability and change in Idaho for the past 30 to 100 years. Now published in Weather, Climate and Society, the research is coupled with outreach literature and a website soon to be made available to the public.</p> 
  <h4><strong>Biographies</strong></h4> 
  <p><strong>John Abatzoglou</strong> is an associate professor in the Department of Geography. His research interests are in climate science and meteorology specific to the American West. He works on both theoretical aspects of climate, as well as applied climatology and climate impacts on water resources, ecology and agriculture.</p> 
  <p><strong>Timothy Link</strong> is an associate professor of forest hydrology in the College of Natural Resources. His research focuses broadly on how climate, vegetation, and human activities influence hydrological processes from the point to the small watershed scale. Specific research topics focus on how vegetation affects snowpack and related ecological processes, how climate changes will be manifested in the rain-snow transition zone in complex terrain, and how forest management activities affect water flow, quality, and riparian systems.</p> 
  <p><strong>Penny Morgan</strong> is a professor in the College of Natural Resources. She earned her bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Utah State University and her doctorate at the University of Idaho. Her current research focuses on some of the broad challenges facing people in the West: How will the changing climate influence fire occurrence and severity? Where, when and why do fires burn severely? What drives landscape dynamics, and how can we best manage landscape change? How does vegetation recover following large fires, and how does post-fire management affect weeds and other vegetation regrowth?</p>

  <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3> 
  <p>Coeur d’Alene tribal professionals in natural and cultural resources and tribal elders, and University of Idaho faculty researchers in anthropology, data management, natural resources, and virtual-world technology worked as co-investigators on a project that demonstrates the value and applicability of indigenous knowledge/practice as complementary to empirical science in addressing climate change. The project focuses on the Schitsu’umsh knowledge and practice, called <em>hnkhwelkhwlnet</em> “our ways of life in the world,” associated with the traditional root food, <em>sqigwts / Sagittaria latifolia</em> (“water potato”). The <em>hnkhwelkhwlnet</em> insights offered are applicable to climate change, vividly demonstrating how a place-based tribe responds to changes in its environment over time.</p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>The first discovery of fossils in the Clarkia area was in 1972 during the construction of a snowmobile racetrack. The fossils, primarily plant remains, are preserved in the sediments of a Miocene lake bed. The lake was formed 15 million to 15&frac12; million years ago by the damming of a drainage basin very similar to the present day St. Maries River basin. The ancient lake was relatively narrow and as deep as 100 to 150 meters. Because of cold, anoxic bottom water and a high rate of sedimentation, preservation of the local biota was excellent. During the last 15 million years, this area has remained tectonically stable, resulting in little post-depositional change of any biota remains trapped in the sediments. Leaves often show original fall colors (brown, red and yellow).</p> 
  <h4>Biography</h4>

  <h4><strong>Abstract</strong></h4> 
  <p>The law is commonly understood – by lawyers and non-lawyers alike – as text. And the practice of law is similarly understood as an exercise in the interpretation of text as it might apply in a particular factual context. But the law is, of course, more than just text. Law is an integral component of the physical landscape, and contemporary landscapes are shaped by law as much as any other factor.</p> 
  <p>Law is also a product of the landscapes it helps create, as our cultural understandings of nature, its purpose, and our relationship with it develop as we interact with specific places and landscapes. As we seek to understand particular places and the people who are parts of those places, and specifically how we might appropriately manage natural resources and landscapes, we must learn to recognize the law as its winds its way through and creates a place. In this presentation, Prof. Long will share stories of a few places in the Greater Yellowstone area of southeastern Idaho to illustrate how we might better understand the interactions of law, culture, and the meaning of the physical landscape. </p>

  <h4><strong>Abstract</strong></h4> 
  <p>The music of J. S. Bach has such universal appeal because it speaks to universal human experience. Suffering, alienation, death, yearning, redemption: these are the big questions Bach addresses in his sacred vocal music. This year’s Idaho Bach Festival (October 15-17) features some of Bach’s most heart-rending settings of religious texts: “Lass, o Welt, mich aus Verachtung in betr&uuml;bter Einsamkeit” (“Leave me, o scornful world, in troubled loneliness”) and “Ich habe genug” (“I have enough”). This presentation will explore Bach’s musical treatment of serious religious subject matter in these compositions and will include a performance of movements from his Six Suites for Solo Cello.</p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4> 
  <p>Gabourey Sidibe rose to fame in 2009 with her Oscar-nominated performance in Precious and quickly became an icon of inclusivity in Hollywood. As U.S. media increasingly touted the rise of a “post-racial” culture in the wake of the election of the first black president, Sidibe’s successes on American Horror Story, The Big C and Fox’s new hit Empire seemingly demonstrated new possibilities for those whose body size and skin tone deviate from traditional definitions of stardom. This talk explores these possibilities as well as the limitations of “post-racial” stardom by analyzing the insistent focus on self-confidence in Sidibe’s star persona. Exploring the relationship between post-racial media discourse and neoliberal individualism, the presentation will show how Sidibe’s star persona celebrates individual solutions to social problems and a colorblind model of universal womanhood. </p>

  <h4><strong>Abstract</strong></h4> 
  <p>The five tribes of Idaho (Coeur d’Alene, Kootenai, Nez Perce, Shoshone-Bannock tribes, and the Shoshone-Paiute tribes) have transformed into regional economic powerhouses over the past quarter century. Their economic footprints now exceed $1 billion annually. The tribes are ranked in the top three largest employers for each of their respective regional economies. Their robust economic contributions arise from their unique role in Idaho’s economy. Each of the tribes is an independent sovereign nation that carries out functions similar to those of state governments. In addition, each is a full-scale economic development agency with unique private-public partnerships. This presentation will outline the economic activities of the five Idaho tribes, their roles in regional economies, and growth possibilities for the future. </p> 
  <h4><strong>Biography</strong></h4> 
  <p>Steven Peterson is a clinical assistant professor of economics at the UI, where he has been employed for 23 years. He has conducted more than 100 economic impact or other related economic studies covering almost every aspect of Idaho’s economy. Steven has been working with the Tribes in Idaho for more than 20 years. He has active partnerships across campus, including those with the Department of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology, the College of Natural Resources, and Agricultural Extension.

  <h3><strong> Abstract </strong></h3> 
  <p>The presenters shall tag-team to talk about genre, gender, nationalism and performance in Shakespeare’s Cymbeline, which opens April 30 at the Hartung Theatre. Rather than say more or too much about Cymbeline, perhaps your interest in our presentation and in the performance can be coaxed with Marjorie Garber’s comments on the play:</p> 
  <p style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: medium none; padding: 0px;""> “Part history, part romance, part revenge tragedy, and part satire, incorporating pastoral themes and lyric songs of an unusual beauty, Cymbeline, King of Britain is a curious play, presenting one of Shakespeare’s most complicated and hard-to-summarize plots. ... There is nothing wrong with calling Cymbeline an experiment, unless by that we mean to undercut its standing as a play worth reading, staging, remembering, and discussing. For this is a play that tackles, and to a large extent solves, an intriguing set of problems about the relationship between political stories and psychological stories, between the sate or polity and the subject, and between the political fiction and the dream.” <em>(Shakespeare After All)</em></p>

  <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3> 
  <br /> No major American writer wrote more – and more powerfully – about war than did Ernest Hemingway. In fact, Prof. McFarland writes, “I’d be inclined to make the universal statement, possibly setting aside Tolstoy (as Hemingway himself would likely have done).” This presentation expands on a theme from Prof. McFarland’s recently published book, Appropriating Hemingway, which examines ways in which Ernest Hemingway has been introduced or “appropriated” as an important fictional character in more than 30 novels, several short stories, graphic novels, movies, plays and poems.

In addition, he is an adviser for creative writing track majors in English and serves on committees or directs MA and MFA theses. He helped establish the University of Idaho’s highly regarded literary magazine, Fugue, more than 20 years ago.

  <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3> 
  <br /> The past 50 years have seen computing move from a fringe activity in universities to a central part of academic life. Today's university students never knew a world without personal computers, networks, email and the World Wide Web. Nowadays, the computers and software used at universities are commercial products, but this was not always the case. For 30 years, academic computing diverged from the mainstream. Universities built and operated their own state-of-the-art systems, leading the development of timesharing and local area (campus) networks. As a student, faculty member, and administrator Prof. Arms lived through many of these developments. For 17 years, he was in charge of computing at two leading universities, Dartmouth College and Carnegie Mellon. This talk tells the story.
  <br /> 
  <br /> 
  <h3><strong>Biography</strong></h3> 
  <br /> 
  <strong>William Arms</strong> is professor emeritus of computing and information science at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. Throughout his career, he has been a leader in implementing innovative computing in higher education, including educational computing, computer networks, and digital libraries. Earlier in his career, he was a faculty member at the British Open University, the pioneer of distance education.
  <br /> 
  <br /> Prof. Arms has been influential in shaping the National Science Foundation’s digital library programs, including the Digital Libraries Initiative and the National Science Digital Library. His recent research has centered on the Cornell Web Lab, a large-scale project to analyze historic collections from the web. He holds a bachelor’s degree from Balliol College at Oxford University, a master’s degree from the London School of Economics and a doctorate from the University of Sussex, all in the United Kingdom. Prof. Arms’ father, Henry Shull, graduated from the University of Idaho in 1936 and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford that year.
  <br />

  <br /> 
  <br /> 
  <p>Prof. Tallent will report on a multi-year research project by the Society of Professional Journalists’ Journalism Education Committee about the state of high school journalism in the United States. The project builds on a historic 1974 survey (”Captive Voices: High School Journalism in America”) and documents changes in high school journalism over the past four decades. The research also examines U.S. Supreme Court decisions that limit student journalism in secondary school. The project found evidence of lack of support for journalism classes and student publications from administrators, teachers, parents, journalism professionals and higher education journalism programs. The committee’s findings are reported in a book due for publication this year by New Forums Press: “Still Captive? History, Law and the Teaching of High School Journalism.” </p>

  <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> 
  <p>As early as 1908, the Olmsted Brothers advised the University of Idaho to move closer to and become a part of the city of Moscow. Cost and the regional railroad yard were often impediments to this town-gown relationship. Recent railroad abandonments have now made this vision more attainable. During the last 20 years, students of the College of Art and Architecture, developers and city planning offices have grown to see the potential of this once industrial site. Incisive student work in 2007 (illustrated above), supported by the city’s planning efforts, have turned this one-time industrial area into a grand dream and potential for city and university. This presentation will illustrate both the potential of this site as well as the useful ways in which students of the academy and real-life planning can mesh in productive ways.</p> 
  <p><strong>Biography</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>D. Nels Reese</strong> taught in the UI’s Department of Architecture from 1987 to 2008. His academic work was focused on urban planning and architectural design. Previous to his teaching role, Reese served as director of Facility Planning at the university for seven years. Along with urban planning, he taught architectural graphics, history of American architecture, and American Studies. Reese received his master’s degree in urban planning from the City College of New York, where he studied with Jonathan Barnett, a noted professor of urban design. In 1992-93, Reese worked on the Bronx Center Project, which was published and shown in the national exhibition, “Urban Revisions for the Public Realm.” He also studied urban models based on the neighborhoods of New York City and led a number of study-related field trips to the Big Apple. Reese has been a member of the Moscow Planning and Zoning Commission for 18 years and concurrently serves on the Moscow Historic Preservation Commission, where he was chair for four years.</p>

  <p>Tom Drake set out to design an interdisciplinary course built around what students think about more than anything else:&nbsp;themselves.&nbsp; He wanted a class that would be both immediately valuable to them, serving their current interests, needs and desires, while simultaneously serving them throughout the entirety of their lives, regardless of their careers or life paths.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Based on these criteria, he decided on a course addressing the most fundamental questions we all ask:&nbsp; What is love? What is happiness? How I can love and be loved?&nbsp; Will loving make me happy?&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>Now in its fourth year, the course looks at what various religious, philosophical and literary traditions and sources, as well as contemporary scientific approaches and research, have to say about these questions.&nbsp;Ideally, the course&nbsp;provides students an opportunity to learn about great intellectual movements while looking into their own most intimate desires, hopes and fears.</p>

  <h3><strong> Abstract </strong></h3> One Health is a concept that integrates human, animal, and environmental health. Recognizing that the health of each part of this triad is inextricably linked to the others, proponents include the American Medical Association, American Veterinary Medical Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Environmental Health Association. Complex health-related issues like climate change, food production, chemical resistance, disease transmission, environmental contamination, land use, and regulatory decisions have dire consequences that require effective communication among experts in multiple disciplines, policymakers, and the lay public. This presentation is intended to enhance awareness of One Health and to inspire efforts toward improving interdisciplinary communication and collaboration that are essential as we respond to local, national and global health challenges.

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>Airports today are much like railroads in the old Wild West in which communities connected by rail usually thrived while those not connected by rail often died. Airports are essential for modern economic development, particularly for isolated, rural regions of the United States.</p> 
  <p>For Pullman-Moscow, air travel is especially important given its geographically isolated location and underdeveloped highways and limited rail service. Currently, the Pullman-Moscow Airport is at a crossroads. The total cost of the planned realignment project is projected to reach $120 million. While most of funding will be provided by federal government, the project requires sizable local matching funds. In addition, the project is complicated by the airport’s unique two-state, two-community and two-university jurisdiction.</p> 
  <p>While the costs to the communities are substantial, prior analyses suggest that benefits are benefits are likely to be much higher than costs and will likely increase sharply in the future. The focus of this study was to fully assess the impact and integration of the Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport in the regional economy and its future role after the runway realignment.</p>

  <p>A basketball player? A guitarist? A scientist? If you had asked your 6th-grade self to describe who you were — to explain your identity — how would you have responded? And what is your reply to that same question today? How we view ourselves, and how those views and descriptions change over time and with different audiences, set the stage for achieving our own potential as professionals and as people. </p> 
  <p>During this colloquium, Lee Vierling will share his experiences working across a wide range of professional disciplines to solve problems, and use these experiences to discuss recent work by colleagues at the College of Natural Resources’ McCall Outdoor Science School (MOSS) to study how young learners develop their own sense of identity by practicing science. We will engage in a group exercise to understand how our own identities are shaped by those around us, and how this affects our ability to work as individuals and in teams. </p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>In 1935, Soviet military intelligence sent Artur Aleksandrovich Adams on a secret mission in the United States. Over the next decade, working as a technical engineer, Adams recruited and ran a spy ring whose tentacles reached from Washington to Los Alamos. In 1944, he gave Moscow critical information on the American super-secret Manhattan Project. Evading an FBI dragnet, he returned to the U.S.S.R., where he died in 1969, a forgotten man.</p> 
  <p>In fact, Adams’ work for the Soviet “secret services” began as early as 1918. An examination of available records reveals his constant re-invention of himself to disguise his clandestine work and even shows that he was less than honest with his Soviet superiors. Did “Arthur Adams” ever really exist at all, and if he didn’t, who was he?</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>Approximately 190 million people in the United States play video games, and the rate of engagement in this form of entertainment is increasing rapidly. Video games are therefore a viable avenue for the large-scale dissemination of educational material. The “gamer” demographic also facilitates broader impacts related to diversity and recruitment in STEM fields. For example, 48 percent of gamers are women and girls, and women over 30 are the single largest demographic sector of video game players.</p> 
  <p>We are working with undergraduate and graduate students from engineering, science and the arts to create evolutionary video games. Our premise is that evolutionary biology can be used to make better video games, because the enemies evolve and adapt to player defensive strategies. Because these games are built upon real models of evolution, they can be used to teach, demonstrate and study evolutionary biology. These projects also allow students to experience the discomfort and rewards of interdisciplinary collaboration and build their communication skills.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>Using technology in the classroom has helped students improve their knowledge and critical thinking skills, as well as keep them engaged and interested in a variety of subjects such as math, history, geography and finance. Nationwide, more schools are receiving funding for technology in the classroom. However, many teachers are struggling to find meaningful ways to incorporate these technologies into the classroom.</p> 
  <p>Two Family and Consumer Sciences Extension faculty, Martha Raidl and Rhea Lanting, worked with a College of Education technology specialist, Cassidy Hall, to address this problem by designing a youth online curriculum called “The e-Potato: A multidisciplinary and multimedia program.” It is focused around potatoes, a commonly consumed vegetable, especially by children. Originally designed as a farm-to-school program, as a way to introduce local agriculture into a nutrition program, the “e-Potato” was expanded to be used by students to cover nine disciplines: science, technology, engineering, math, history, geography, health, nutrition and agriculture.</p> 
  <h3>Biography</h3> 
  <p><strong>Martha Raidl</strong> is a professor and extension nutrition education specialist for the School of Family and Consumer Sciences. She has been employed with the University of Idaho since 1998 and is based in Boise. As a registered dietitian, she is interested in developing, testing and evaluating nutrition education materials, targeting those with Type 2 diabetes, and incorporating multimedia into nutrition education programs.</p> 
  <p><strong>Cassidy Hall</strong> is the interim director and technology integration specialist for the College of Education’s Doceo Center for Innovation + Learning, as well as a clinical assistant professor of learning technologies in the Department of Curriculum &amp; Instruction. Hall travels throughout the state to provide professional development focused on technology integration to K-12 teachers and leads the Doceo Center efforts in supporting technology integration for faculty on campus.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>The presence of water in liquid form is the single most important factor in the search for extraterrestrial life. Here on earth, it has been said that water is the oil of the future. It is not. The fact that water is essential for life and has no substitute means that while its use can be improved and enhanced through technology, careful consideration of socioeconomic factors and governance are of equal importance.</p> 
  <p>Australia and the western United States share both a legal foundation in British common law and climatic conditions of aridity. This suggests that Australia and the western U.S. might learn from each other as each prepares to adapt to the changes in water demand and supply that are beginning to play out at the intersection of climate change and growth in population.</p> 
  <p>Australia was the initial ground for experimentation when it responded to the 15-year Millennium Drought with water reform. California is now ground zero. Because Idaho is the second-largest user of water for irrigated agriculture in the United States, the largest user of water for aquaculture and the most reliant on groundwater for domestic and municipal purposes, it may be able to learn from these experiments. This presentation will discuss why and how we allocate water and what that means for response to drought in Australia and the western United States.</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3> 
  <p>When you see or hear a media account of a court decision, you will learn who “won” and “lost” — and the story often will be accompanied by quotes of praise or condemnation from the parties and various interest groups. In a high-profile case, you also may find yourself immersed in punditry about the political implications of the decision or the perceived political leanings of the judge(s).</p> 
  <p>But how much will you learn about the legal principle(s) governing the court’s decision? Has your secondary and post-secondary education prepared you to look for the “rule of law” in reports of court decisions?</p> 
  <p>In today’s environment of hyper-partisanship, how fully do Americans understand (and appreciate) the role of an independent and impartial judiciary as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution? Drawing upon illustrative cases and interdisciplinary scholarship, professor Don Burnett will address these questions.</p>
